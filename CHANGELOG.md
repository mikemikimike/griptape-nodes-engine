# Changelog

All notable changes to Griptape Nodes will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/2.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
**Breaking** marks a change that can stop a saved workflow, a node library, or a client of
the engine's request API from working without edits. Migration steps live in
[MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

## [0.103.0] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- **Breaking:** The setting `worker.heartbeat_startup_grace_s` is now `worker.library_load_timeout_s`
  (env `GTN_CONFIG_WORKER__LIBRARY_LOAD_TIMEOUT_S`). With its heartbeat role removed, what it bounds
  is how long a worker may take to load its library, which the new name states. A config file still
  setting the old name silently falls back to the 600 second default.
- Workflows run in a subprocess now verify TLS certificates against the operating system's trust
  store, matching the app.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** The engine no longer patches `httpx`, `httpx2`, and `requests` to read `file://` URLs,
  local paths, and cloud asset URLs in workflows run or published in a subprocess. Nodes that fetched
  those through `httpx`, `httpx2`, or `requests` must read the file directly instead.

### Fixed

- A `Workflow Node` now starts each parameter it exposes from a workflow's `Start Flow` node with
  the value set on that `Start Flow` node, instead of leaving it empty. The value is saved with the
  workflow, so a workflow saved before this release needs saving again to carry it. Values such as
  images keep the parameter's own default.
  [#5698](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5698)
- The process a library runs isolated in shuts down within about 35 seconds of losing the engine
  that started it. Before, if that engine exited in the process's first 10 minutes, the process
  stayed up until those 10 minutes had passed. `worker.library_load_timeout_s` no longer delays
  that check; it still bounds how long the engine waits for the process to load its library.
  Setting `worker.heartbeat_timeout_s` below 30 seconds does not shorten this, on purpose: a busy
  engine can be slow to challenge, and a library's process must not read that as an engine that died.
- A library whose isolated process shuts down before loading it now reports that as soon as the
  process goes, instead of waiting out `worker.library_load_timeout_s` and then blaming a library
  load that never finished.
- Installing a library's dependencies no longer gives the engine an older copy of a package the
  engine itself imports. A library's environment comes ahead of the engine's own on the import path,
  so a library that resolved, for instance, an older `griptape` handed that copy to the engine too.
  Library installs now carry the engine's own versions as minimum versions, so such a package
  resolves no older than the engine's. A library that genuinely needs an older one is still
  installed and still works; it is now listed in that library's problems, naming what it supplies
  and what the engine expected, where before nothing connected the two.
  [#5681](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5681)
  [#5682](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5682)
- Creating or switching to a project whose workspace differs now closes the open workflow, returning
  you to the workflow picker. Before, the engine kept a workflow it no longer had a record of, so the
  next workflow you opened sat on "Checking workflow" and the log filled with "is not registered on
  this engine" warnings until you restarted the engine.
  [#5692](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5692)
- Saving a file from a workflow you have not saved yet no longer logs a stream of "Optional builtin
  'workflow_dir' could not be resolved" warnings. `workflow_dir` now answers with the folder your
  first save would default to, read from the project's `save_workflow` situation, so a project that
  points workflow saves outside the workspace root writes those files there rather than at the root.
  [#5669](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5669)
- Creating a versioned output folder or file sequence in a project no longer fails with "requires
  at most one unresolved variable" when its path uses a project directory such as `{outputs}`.
  `GetNextVersionIndexRequest` now fills in project directories and built-in variables itself, so
  callers only supply their own variables.
- A parameter that a node both shows and passes on, such as the text on a text node, keeps an edit
  made after the node has run. Before, reopening the workflow or refreshing the page showed the
  value from the last run instead of the edit.
- Renaming a parameter that holds an output value now reports that the old name no longer has one,
  alongside the new name's value. Before, only the new name was reported, so anything tracking
  output values by parameter name kept the old name's value.
- Saving HEIC, AVIF, or ICO bytes no longer rewrites the destination's extension to match the
  detected format, and no longer fails when `coerce_extension_to_match_bytes` is off. The engine
  does not recognize these formats, so the file is written at the extension you asked for and a
  warning is logged.
  [#5614](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5614)

### Added

- `claude-sonnet-5-5` is available in Griptape Cloud model dropdowns and the chat sidebar.
- Projects have two new situations for versioned output folders. `save_output_directory` creates
  `{outputs}/renders_v001`, then `renders_v002` on the next run. `save_file_sequence` writes each
  run's frames into a new version folder, such as `frames_v001/frames.0001.png`. Node libraries
  use them through `ProjectDirectoryParameter` and `ProjectFileSequenceParameter`. Projects on
  the legacy template fall back to the same layout. See
  [Situations](https://docs.griptapenodes.com/en/stable/guides/projects/situations/#save_output_directory).

## [0.102.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Libraries can list heavy packages under `pip_dependencies_exec` in their manifest. Those install
  into a separate `.venv-exec` and load only in the library's own process, where its nodes run, so
  libraries with clashing heavy pins can be installed side by side.
- A node in a library that runs isolated in a worker can hand an unserializable value, such as a
  diffusers pipeline or a latent tensor, to the next node. Mark the producing output
  `serializable=False` and the engine holds the object in the worker, sending an opaque key in its
  place that the consuming node's read resolves. See
  [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md#serializablefalse-outputs-are-held-in-their-own-process-across-a-worker-boundary).
- Claude Opus 5.5, GPT-6 Sol, and GPT-6 Luna are in the model catalog.
- Nodes can implement `validate_in_execution_environment()` to run a check where the node itself runs,
  which for a library isolated in its own process is where its heavy packages are importable and its
  inputs are the real objects. A node that fails the check reports why in
  `ExecuteNodeResultFailure.validation_exceptions` instead of crashing partway through.
- You can try new features early by turning them on from the **Beta Features** page in the
  editor's settings, and turn them off again at any time. Node libraries can offer beta features
  of their own. See
  [Beta Features](https://docs.griptapenodes.com/en/stable/guides/editor/beta_features/), and
  [Authoring Libraries](https://docs.griptapenodes.com/en/stable/development/custom_nodes/authoring_libraries/#beta-features)
  to add them to a library.
- The `Slider` trait, and `ParameterInt` and `ParameterFloat` with `slider=True`, take
  `soft_limits=True`. The slider then spans its range, but a value typed outside it is accepted
  instead of rejected, matching soft limits in Nuke, Maya, and Houdini.
  [#5269](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5269)
- Custom traits can keep settings a node changes at runtime, such as a narrowed range, when the
  workflow is saved and reopened, by implementing `to_state()` and `apply_state()`. See
  [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md#traits-can-save-runtime-state).

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `WorkflowPackager.package_to_folder` returns a `PackagedBundle` with the bundled
  workflow's path and the library paths, instead of a list of library paths. See
  [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md#package_to_folder-reports-where-it-put-the-workflow).
  [#5326](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5326)
- An app event raised in one process is no longer delivered to listeners in another. A library running
  isolated in its own process reports to the engine by sending a request instead.
- **Breaking:** When a parameter's `ui_options` and a custom trait set the same key, the trait's
  value now wins, so node code can no longer override a trait's widget settings through
  `ui_options`. Implement `state_from_ui_options()` on the trait to accept these overrides, or
  change the trait's own attributes instead.
- Setting a value outside a `Slider` range now fails with an error naming the parameter, the value,
  and the allowed range, instead of "Value out of range".
  [#5269](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5269)

### Removed

- **Breaking:** `LibraryLoadedNotification` no longer carries `node_schemas`. A library that loaded in
  its own process reports its schemas to the engine with the new `ReportLibraryLoadedRequest`, and the
  notification that follows says only how the load went.
- `TraitRegistry` and `Trait.get_trait_keys()` are removed, with no replacement, since nothing read
  them. Custom traits no longer need to implement `get_trait_keys()`, and existing implementations
  can be deleted.
- The engine no longer runs its own static file server. The Griptape Nodes app serves the
  workspace, as it has since v0.95.0. `STATIC_SERVER_ENABLED` is gone.

### Fixed

- Connecting a video, image, or audio file uploaded through the editor to a node that requires that
  media type no longer fails with a message saying the parameter must be an artifact.
- Image, video, audio, and 3D parameters no longer fail when given an inline `data:` URI longer than
  the operating system's file name limit, which any real image exceeds. The URI is kept as the
  parameter's value.
- Image, video, audio, and 3D inputs given a file path use the file where it already is, instead of
  copying it into `staticfiles/`. The copy could overwrite a different file with the same name. A
  saved workflow now depends on its input files staying put: moving, renaming, or deleting one
  breaks the workflow, and an input outside the workspace is referenced by its absolute path, so the
  project is no longer portable across machines for those inputs.
  [#5647](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5647)
- Model dropdowns no longer mark every model "Not permitted by your license" when two installed
  libraries provide a node with the same name.
  [#5618](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5618)
- Group nodes in a reopened workflow show the ports and connections of parameters added to the
  group again.
  [#5563](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5563)
- A node can be deleted while a workflow is running. Deleting a node the run still needs cancels the
  run; deleting any other node lets it finish.
- Image previews no longer break when several requests regenerate the same preview at once, and
  synced or copied images are no longer treated as changed on every view. When a preview cannot be
  made, the engine reports why.
- Workflows created from a template or by branching are saved where the project saves workflows,
  instead of always in the workspace folder. Branching twice no longer overwrites the first branch.
- Packaging a workflow stops with an error when the workflow or one of its files has the same name
  as a file the bundle reserves.
  [#5323](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5323)
- `RunWorkflowWithCurrentStateRequest` fails when a workflow is already open, instead of attaching
  the target as a hidden flow that was saved and run along with the open workflow.
  [#5526](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5526)
- A slider range, dropdown choices, or button link that a node changes at runtime now survives
  saving and reopening the workflow. Before, the reopened workflow showed the saved settings, but
  sliders checked the old range, dropdowns the old choices, and buttons opened the old link.
  [#5440](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5440)
- Changing a slider's range or a dropdown's choices through `ui_options`, from node code or the
  editor, now also changes which values the parameter accepts. Before, the editor showed the new
  range or choices, but the parameter still checked values against the old ones.
  [#5440](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5440)
- Nodes in a library that runs isolated in its own process no longer stop working mid-session while
  the engine is busy. That process is now dropped for leaving heartbeat challenges unanswered rather
  than for elapsed time, so `worker.heartbeat_timeout_s` bounds unanswered challenges instead of
  wall-clock silence.
- A node that writes a list or dictionary to an output and reads it back gets the same object rather
  than a copy of it, and a value that refers to itself no longer fails the node with a
  `RecursionError`. Inline `{VAR}` substitution returns a value it did not rewrite unchanged.
