- `NodeErrorEvent` has an optional `error` field that holds a node failure in parts: the node's own
  message without the engine's "Attempted to execute node" wrapping or a leading node name, the
  exception type, one message per problem when a node fails validation, and anything the node
  attached with `NodeError`. When the engine wrote the failure itself, such as a worker that stopped
  responding, `error.message` is the engine's text. `ExecuteNodeResultFailure.error` carries the
  same parts back from the process the node ran in. `error_message` is unchanged.
