- Image, video, audio, and 3D inputs set from a file path now store a macro path such as
  `{inputs}/cat.png` for files in a project directory or the workspace, and the absolute path
  otherwise, instead of copying the file into `staticfiles/` and storing a `localhost` URL.
  Workflows read those files from disk, so headless and published runs no longer need the
  desktop app running, and values saved as `localhost` URLs by earlier versions are read from
  disk too.
