"""Worker-side dispatch overrides for orchestrator-owned request types.

On a worker, a handful of request types must be serviced by the orchestrator
because the authoritative state (flow graph, connections, node registry) lives
there. This module provides:

- ``LOCAL_ONLY_REQUEST_TYPES``: the request classes a worker answers ITSELF. Every other
  registered type gets a ``RemoteHandler`` that forwards to the orchestrator.
- ``RemoteHandler``: an async callable that replaces the original manager
  handler for those request types on the worker. While the worker is actively
  executing a node it forwards; outside that scope it delegates back to the
  original local handler (which preserves bootstrap / library-load behavior).
- ``register_remote_handlers``: swaps the dispatch table entries on a
  just-configured worker after ``configure_worker_forwarding`` has wired up
  the RequestClient and loop references.
- ``ReloadConfigRequest`` / ``RefreshSecretsRequest`` and their Success/Failure
  payloads: orchestrator-originated broadcasts that every worker handles
  locally to re-read shared on-disk state. They live here, not in
  ``worker_events.py``, because their reason for existing is a routing
  decision (orchestrator fan-out to all workers); the names are deliberately
  free of any "Worker" prefix because, by this module's principle, an event's
  type carries no routing metadata.

The routing decision lives entirely on the worker. Events themselves carry no
routing metadata.
