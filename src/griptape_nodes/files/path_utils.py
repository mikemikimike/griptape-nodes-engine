"""Path utilities for file operations.

Comprehensive path handling utilities including:
- Path sanitization (shell escapes, quotes, newlines)
- Path expansion (tilde, environment variables)
- Path resolution (relative paths, cross-platform)
- Path normalization (Windows long paths, etc.)
- Workspace operations (relative path conversions)
- file:// URI parsing
- URL discrimination (telling a URL apart from a filesystem path)

These utilities provide consistent path handling across the codebase
and are used by OSManager, FileDrivers, and workspace managers.

    No-op on non-Windows platforms and on paths that already carry the prefix.
    UNC paths (``\\server\share``) get the ``\\?\UNC\`` variant.

    The prefix is applied **unconditionally** on Windows, not only when the
    string already exceeds ``WINDOWS_MAX_PATH``. The old length gate meant a
    short root path (e.g. a destination under ``%TEMP%``) was handed to the
    filesystem unprefixed, and per-file leaf paths built from it later — during
    a recursive copy that descends into a deep source tree — grew past MAX_PATH
    without ever inheriting the prefix, raising ``WinError 206``. Applying the
    prefix at the root lets ``pathlib``/``os.path`` joins carry it through to
    every leaf. The ``\\?\`` prefix is safe to apply to a sub-MAX_PATH path on
    modern Windows.

    Precondition: ``path_str`` must be a fully-qualified, backslash-separated
    Windows path (absolute drive path like ``C:\\dir`` or UNC ``\\\\server\\share``).
    The ``\\?\`` prefix disables Win32 path normalization, so a relative path
    (``sub\\file``) or a forward-slash path (``C:/dir``) would become an invalid
    ``\\?\`` string. Both current callers (``normalize_path_for_platform``,
    ``canonicalize_for_io``) absolutize and normalize before calling, so this
    holds; the guard below returns such inputs unchanged rather than producing a
    broken prefix, so a future caller can't silently create one.

    `strip_surrounding_quotes` only sees quotes wrapping the WHOLE string, which is the shape a

    into the interior -- `ROOT='"/mnt/studio"'` turns `${ROOT}/libs` into `"/mnt/studio"/libs`, where
    there is nothing left to strip. The damage is not cosmetic: a leading quote makes
    `Path.is_absolute()` False, so an absolute path silently becomes a relative one and gets anchored
    somewhere the author never named.

    Refusing beats cleaning, because an interior quote is ambiguous by then and the wrong guess is
    silent. Two rules keep the refusal from swallowing real directory names:

    - A `"` that expansion introduced is always quoting. Windows forbids it in a filename outright,
      and it is the character shells and macOS Finder wrap paths in, so it did not come from a
      directory called `He said "hi"`.
    - A quote of either kind is refused only in the LEADING position, which is the one that flips
      `is_absolute()`. An interior `'` is left alone: `/mnt/Dragon's Curse` is an ordinary directory
      that a variable may legitimately hold, and `sanitize_path_string` documents apostrophes as a
      supported case.

    The DECLARED text is exempt from both rules. A quote someone typed into their own project.yml is
    unambiguously theirs, and honoring it is what makes the refusal specific to expansion.

    `${ROOT}`, while the path actually handed downstream has it filled in.

    Expansion is looped over the string rather than a `Path` so intermediate values are not
    renormalized (`/` to `\\` on Windows) between passes; the `Path` is built once at the end.

    A self-referential value (`A=${A}`) is not a cycle here: `os.path.expandvars` leaves it alone,

    The counterpart to `path_needs_expansion`: that asks whether a raw value needs expanding, this
    asks what expansion could not supply. A caller that finds anything here knows the path has no
    real answer yet and can name what is missing, instead of treating `${LIBS}` or `{outputs}` as a
    directory name.

    Call it on `expand_path_fully`'s output, not `expand_path`'s: a single pass leaves the inner
    reference of `LIBS=${ROOT}/libs` behind, so scanning it reports `ROOT` as unsupplied when it is
    set and the value resolves fine.

    Reporting only, no policy: whether a `{NAME}` macro token is legal in a given field is the
    caller's rule (they are not legal in project path fields; see `resolve_project_path_field`), and
    whether an unsupplied variable is fatal depends on the caller too.

    Three deliberate limits:
    - A bare `$NAME` is NOT reported. `os.path.expandvars` accepts that form -- a set `$NAME` does
      expand -- but an unexpanded `$Recycle.Bin` is indistinguishable from a real directory of that
      name, so an unexpanded one stays literal. Only `${NAME}` and `%NAME%` are unambiguous enough to
      call out.
    - `%NAME%` is only expanded by `os.path.expandvars` on Windows, so on other platforms it is
      reported even when the variable IS set. That is the honest answer: the value did not expand.
      The cost is a POSIX path with two literal percent signs around a name-shaped run of characters
      (`/srv/%share%/x`) being called out as unresolved. Requiring a leading letter or underscore
      keeps the common encodings out of it -- `%20`, `%2F` and friends do not match -- which leaves
      the false positive rare enough to prefer over silently creating a `%NAME%` directory on the one
      platform where a cross-platform project.yml would not have expanded it.
    - A variable that is SET BUT EMPTY cannot be reported. It expands to nothing and leaves no
      delimiters behind, so by the time a value reaches here `${EMPTY}/libs` and `/libs` are the same
      string. Callers that care must compare against the pre-expansion value themselves.

    This function breaks down a file path into three components:
    - Drive/volume/mount identifier (optional): For Windows drives, macOS volumes, Linux mounts
    - Subdirectories (optional): Directory path between the root/drive and the filename
    - Filename (required): The actual file name with extension

    Cross-platform support: This method detects path patterns from all platforms (Windows drives,
    macOS volumes, Linux mounts, UNC paths) regardless of the current OS. This is necessary because
    paths must be consistently decomposed even when a project created on one platform is
    opened on another (e.g., a Windows path "C:\temp\file.txt" stored in project metadata must
    be correctly decomposed when opened on macOS).

    Args:
        absolute_path: Source file path to decompose (should be absolute)
        workspace_dir: Workspace directory for relative path detection.
