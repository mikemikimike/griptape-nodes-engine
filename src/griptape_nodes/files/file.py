    Handles four shapes of input, in this order:

    1. A ``file://`` URI is converted to the local path it names, then absolutized.
    2. A localhost static file server URL
       (``http://localhost:8124/workspace/staticfiles/clip.mp4?v=...``) is mapped
       back to the workspace file it serves. The engine passes node outputs
       between nodes in this form, and the file is already on disk, so a caller
       that needs a real path gets one without an HTTP round-trip.
    3. Any other URL (a remote ``https://`` address, ``s3://``, …) is returned
       unchanged. There is no local path for it to resolve to, and the consumers
       of ``resolve()`` accept a URL: FFmpeg and ffprobe read ``http(s)``
       natively.
    4. Anything else is a filesystem path. Relative paths are anchored to the
       current workspace directory, matching how OSManager resolves
       ReadFileRequest/WriteFileRequest paths. This keeps resolve() reporting the
       same on-disk location the read/write pipeline targets, instead of a bare
       relative path that a caller would resolve against the process working
       directory. Absolute paths and ``~``/environment-variable paths are
       absolutized in place.

    The URL cases exist because every path helper downstream of here assumes a
    filesystem path. Before this branch, a static server URL fell through to
    ``resolve_file_path`` and was mangled into a string that was neither a URL nor
    a real path -- ``//`` collapsed to the platform separator, the whole URL
    anchored under the workspace, and the ``?t=`` cachebuster still attached --
    which then failed deep inside whatever consumed it.
