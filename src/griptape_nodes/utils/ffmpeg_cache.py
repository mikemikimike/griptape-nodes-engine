r"""Redirect `static_ffmpeg`'s lock and download directory to a writable location.

`static_ffmpeg` resolves ffmpeg/ffprobe by writing next to its own installed package
files, with no environment variable or public setter to move them:

    SELF_DIR  = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))   # static_ffmpeg/run.py:22
    LOCK_FILE = os.path.join(SELF_DIR, "lock.file")          # static_ffmpeg/run.py:23

That breaks any packaging where `site-packages` is read-only. The Linux desktop AppImage
runs as a FUSE-mounted squashfs (`/tmp/.mount_<...>/`), so every ffmpeg-dependent feature
fails with `OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system` before ffmpeg is ever resolved.

Passing `download_dir=` to `get_or_fetch_platform_executables_else_raise()` does not help:
the lock is acquired at `run.py:102`, before `download_dir` is consulted at `run.py:121`.
The lock is what raises. So the module globals themselves have to move.

Reassigning them is safe because both are read at *call* time, not import time:
`LOCK_FILE` inside `get_or_fetch_platform_executables_else_raise()` (`run.py:102`), and
`SELF_DIR` inside `get_platform_dir()` (`run.py:72`). Redirecting `SELF_DIR` moves the
download and extract target along with the lock, and lets `get_platform_dir()` keep
deriving the platform subdirectory itself. Re-verify those two line references when
bumping `static_ffmpeg`.

One redirect covers every caller in the process. The engine imports `static_ffmpeg` at
boot (`artifact_manager` -> `VideoArtifactProvider`), so `sys.modules["static_ffmpeg"]`
is pinned to the engine's own copy and every node library that imports `static_ffmpeg`
receives that same module object -- including libraries whose venvs live elsewhere.
