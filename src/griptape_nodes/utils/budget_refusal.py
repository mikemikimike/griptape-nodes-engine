"""Recognize, word, and re-recognize a Griptape Cloud budget refusal.

When a HARD budget has no room, Cloud refuses the call with HTTP 403 and a body
naming every budget that refused. :func:`refusal_from_body` reads that body,
:func:`describe` and :func:`describe_reply` word it for the artist, and
:func:`halt_message` finds that wording again under whatever wrapped it.

The halt names the node and the budgets and sends the artist to their
administrator, short enough for the editor's Run blocked bar. Cloud's own
``message`` and the credit figures go to :func:`log_line` only.
