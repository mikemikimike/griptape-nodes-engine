        Each entry is a (request_type, handler) pair. The library must own the
        request_type — it should be a RequestPayload subclass defined within
        this library's package. Each request type maps to exactly one handler
        engine-wide; attempting to register a type that already has a handler
        raises a ValueError, surfaced as a RequestHandlerRegistrationProblem.

        The engine registers all returned handlers after after_library_nodes_loaded()
        and deregisters them automatically when the library is unloaded.

        Both sync and async handler callables are supported.

        **Registered per process.** Every library loads on the orchestrator, so its
        handlers always serve requests dispatched there. A library whose nodes execute
        in a worker also loads in that worker, which registers its own copy; the two
        processes never forward handler requests to each other.

        **Singleton handlers only.** This mechanism is for services where exactly
        one library is the provider (e.g. colour conversion, ML inference). For
        competing-provider scenarios — where multiple libraries can each handle the
        same request type and the caller selects one by name at dispatch time (e.g.
        ``PublishWorkflowRequest``) — use ``LibraryManager.on_register_event_handler()``
        in your ``after_library_nodes_loaded`` callback instead. Unification of the
        two registration systems is tracked as future work.

        **Introspection.** Once a library is loaded, other libraries or nodes can
        discover which request types it registered and inspect their field schemas
        using standard Python APIs::

            from griptape_nodes.node_library.library_registry import LibraryRegistry
            import dataclasses, typing

            library = LibraryRegistry.get_library("My Library Name")
            for request_type in library.get_registered_request_handler_types():
                hints = typing.get_type_hints(request_type)
                fields = dataclasses.fields(request_type)
                # hints: {field_name: type, ...}
                # fields: tuple of dataclasses.Field objects with name/default/metadata

        Example:
            def get_request_handlers(self):
                return [
                    (ConvertColorspaceRequest, self._handle_convert_colorspace),
                ]

    def get_post_dispatch_hooks(
        self,
    ) -> list[

            Callable[[RequestPayload, ResultPayload], None]
            | Callable[[RequestPayload, ResultPayload], Awaitable[None]],
        ]
    ]:
        """Return post-dispatch hooks to register with the engine.

        Each entry is a (request_type, callback) pair. After the engine's own
        handler for that request type produces a result, the callback is invoked
        with (request, result). Unlike get_request_handlers(), this does not claim
        the request type — any number of libraries may hook the same type, and the
        engine's handler still runs normally.

        The engine registers all returned hooks after after_library_nodes_loaded()
        and deregisters them automatically when the library is unloaded.

        Both sync and async callbacks are supported. Sync callbacks run in a worker
        thread; async callbacks run on the engine's event loop and must not block it.

        **Notification only.** The callback's return value is ignored and it cannot
        alter the result or fail the operation. A callback that raises is logged and
        otherwise ignored.

        **Usually detached.** Whenever the engine has a live event loop the hook is
        scheduled as a detached task, so the result reaches the client without waiting
        for it. Some paths have no such loop — CLI commands, bootstrap workflow runs,
        worker threads — and there the hook runs inline and blocks the caller until it
        returns, on a transient loop rather than the engine's. Keep hooks quick, or move
        slow work off-process, if they may fire on those paths.

        **Both outcomes.** The callback is invoked for successes and failures alike,
        including failures produced by an exception escaping the handler. Branch on
        the result type to filter.

        **Exact type matching.** A hook registered for a request type fires only for
        that exact type, not for its subclasses.

        **Read-only arguments.** Do not mutate the request or the result: both are
        still referenced by the result event the engine is about to serialize. Fields
        marked ``omit_from_result`` have already been cleared on the request the hook
        receives.

        **Do not issue engine requests from a hook.** The engine's operation-depth and
        node-execution state is process-wide, so a request issued from a hook can
        perturb an in-flight operation. Do external work (HTTP, file writes) instead.

        **Registered per process.** Hooks are registered on the event manager of
        whichever process loads the library. A library whose nodes execute in a worker
        loads in both processes, so each copy observes only the requests its own
        process handles.

        **Not durable.** In-flight hooks are abandoned at process exit. Do not use
        them where delivery must be guaranteed.

        Example:
            def get_post_dispatch_hooks(self):
                return [
                    (SaveWorkflowRequest, self._on_workflow_saved),
