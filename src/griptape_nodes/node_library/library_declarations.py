"""Declarative properties and capabilities for libraries and nodes.

Attached to `LibraryMetadata.declarations` and `NodeMetadata.declarations` and
serialized into `griptape_nodes_library.json`.

Most declarations carry a single value -- multi-knob behavior splits into
separate declarations rather than wider models. The `model_catalog` property
is the deliberate exception: it nests a `provider -> model` registry under one
declaration because the levels share identity (a model id is only meaningful
under its provider). Two categories of declaration ship today:

* **Properties** state an identity fact about the library or node.
* **Capabilities** state what the library or node can do.

The `LibraryDeclaration` and `NodeDeclaration` unions are scaffolded so
that additional declarations slot in additively without churning the
schema shape.
