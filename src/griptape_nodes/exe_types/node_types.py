        computing and what it computes is what travels back when its library runs in its own process.

        The Node may choose to store a different value (or type) than what was passed in.

        a running Flow or forcing an upstream object to alter its assumptions.

        Changing a Parameter may trigger other Parameters within the Node
        to be changed. If other Parameters are changed, the engine needs a list of which

        `parameter_values` always keeps the value, so this only ever adds. What it adds is reach: of the
        node's two stores, `parameter_output_values` is the one that survives egress from a worker, which
        ships produced values back and leaves the node's `parameter_values` behind. A node that reports
        its result with the setter is therefore empty when its library runs isolated, unless the result
        is recorded here as well. Writing both is what a library node does by hand today; doing it in the

        Moving the value here instead of copying it would not do: `parameter_output_values` is transient,
        cleared before each run and by `clear_node`, and a value set during a run often has to outlive it.
        `SeedParameter` is the example -- it rolls a seed mid-run so you can turn randomizing off and keep
        the seed that gave you a result you liked.

        A run is the window because outside it the node is being authored rather than computing, and it
        has to be *this* node running, not any node: a running node can set a value on another node, which
        is how a value reaches a connected input and how a node driving a subflow feeds it. That value is
        not the recipient's result, and filing it as one would lose it to the recipient's pre-run clear.

        Display suppression settles for ``contains_variable_macro``, the cheap
        ``\{[A-Za-z_]`` heuristic, because a false positive there only misdraws a
        field while a false negative is the leak the guard exists to stop.
        Declining a stored-state write is not so forgiving. The heuristic also
        fires on LaTeX (``\textbf{x}``), CSS (``{color: red}``) and prose that
        mentions a dict literal, and declining the write for one of those would
        freeze that parameter's stored value for good -- no group run would ever
        update it again. So parse the tokens instead of trusting the brace.

        Delegates the token-level judgement to ``VariableResolver.would_substitute``,
        which asks the resolver itself rather than re-deriving its rules.

        Copy-back callers run on the orchestrator, where the variable dict is
        available. Where it is not -- a node with no parent flow, as transient worker
        nodes have -- fall back to trusting the heuristic, which errs toward keeping
        the user's text rather than overwriting it. (Substitution being off is not
        one of those cases: ``_variable_template_to_preserve`` has already returned
        early by then, so the only caller never reaches here.)

        The dict is resolved per call, keyed on *this* node's name, rather than reusing
        the one the run substituted with. That leaves a narrow skew -- delete a variable
        between the run and the copy-back and the write goes through -- but the
        alternatives are worse: seeding one dict for a whole copy-back loop would hand
        one flow's variables to a node in another (see the no-per-flow-key note on
        ``get_variables_if_enabled``), and ``_resolve_variables_for_node`` cannot be
        swapped in as-is because it returns ``{}`` where this returns ``None``, and
