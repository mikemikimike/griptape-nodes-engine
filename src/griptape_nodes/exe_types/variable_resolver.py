        SetVariableSubstitutionEnabledRequest writes it, and a generated workflow file emits that as
        it loads -- on the orchestrator. Adopting the orchestrator's workflow context makes the
        lookup index by name rather than short-circuit, but the answer is still the default True.

        The orchestrator encodes "disabled" as an EMPTY variable dict when it pre-seeds one for a
        dispatch, and substituting with an empty dict is not the same as not substituting:
        `{VAR}` is preserved either way, but `{VAR?}` collapses to "" instead of staying literal.

        template -- `node_types._variable_template_to_preserve`, and through it the display value

        backed out: `parameter_output_values[...] = x` inside a node `__init__` reaches this
        through TrackedParameterOutputValues, so every node construction became a bus request.
