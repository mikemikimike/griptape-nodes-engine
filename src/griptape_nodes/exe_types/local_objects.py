"""A node's view of the process-local object store.

Values a library passes between nodes are held for their parameter: a `serializable=False` output is held
when it leaves the process, a reference travels in its place, and the engine releases it when the value is
replaced or the node goes away. This module is for the other case -- a *resource* the library reuses
across runs, like a pipeline whose load takes 30 seconds -- which needs a key the library can name again.

The cache belongs to the worker, not to a library. One worker may host several libraries and they can
hand objects to each other, because they genuinely share a process; what an object cannot do is leave the
process that built it. The scope binds what a node knows and the store does not: which worker it is in,
which library it came from, and which node produced it.
