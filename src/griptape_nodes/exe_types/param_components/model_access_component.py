"""Model-access parameter component for license/policy-gated dropdowns.

Owns the model list and decorates a node's model-selection ``Parameter`` with
an ``Options`` trait, an inline ``Button`` refresh trait, per-row readable
labels, per-row entitlement icons + subtitles, an error badge on denied
selections, and runtime denial queries. Node identity (parameter name, type,
input_types, tooltip) stays with the node so saved workflows round-trip
byte-identically.

Labels are display-only. A row's ``name`` remains the ``provider_model_id``, so
what the parameter stores, what the proxy receives, and what provenance metadata
records are all unchanged by how a row reads. See ``_build_ui_options``.

``model_choices`` are ``provider_model_id``s, which the component resolves to
the catalog ``model_id`` the permission layer gates on. ``deprecated_values``
covers the values a parameter stored before it adopted that convention (an old
display label, a retired provider id): each is accepted wherever a value is
assigned, migrated to its canonical choice, and never offered as a fresh
selection.

Policy itself lives in ``model_policy``, shared with ``HuggingFaceModelParameter``
(which builds its choices by scanning the local HuggingFace cache instead of from
a declared list). The two components own their ``Parameter`` differently and do
not compose, but they must not disagree about whether a model is permitted, so
the snapshot, the query, and the denial wording are common. This component
enumerates its choices at authoring time, so it leaves
``refuse_unrecognized`` off: an id absent from the catalog is an already-vetted
value rather than something to gate user work on.

Usage — one construction step per parameter:

    class DescribeImage(ControlNode):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
            super().__init__(**kwargs)
            model_param = Parameter(
                name="model",
                type="str",
                input_types=["str", "Prompt Model Config"],
                default_value=DEFAULT_MODEL,
                ...,
                # NO traits={Options(...)} -- component adds Options + Button itself.
            )
            self.add_parameter(model_param)
            self._model_access = ModelAccessComponent(
                node=self,
                parameter=model_param,
                model_choices=MODEL_CHOICES,
                default_model=DEFAULT_MODEL,
            )

The component's constructor does everything in one step: fetches the initial
snapshot, validates the parameter, adds the ``Options`` + ``Button`` traits,
sets ``ui_options`` for per-row decoration, applies the initial badge for the
current stored value, and — if the caller's ``default_value`` is denied but a
different value is currently permitted — resets the parameter's stored value
to a permitted alternative via ``set_parameter_value(..., initial_setup=True)``.
The parameter's declarative ``default_value`` is untouched.

Nodes then forward ``after_value_set`` to ``self._model_access.on_value_set(
parameter, value)`` -- the component filters for its own parameter -- and pick a
failure-routing idiom that matches their base class:

  - ControlNode / raise-based execute paths call ``raise_if_selection_denied()``.
  - SuccessFailureNode / GriptapeProxyNode nodes call ``selection_denial()``
    and route the reason into ``self._set_status_results(was_successful=False,
    result_details=denial.reason())``.

Both read the current selection off the parameter the component owns, so a node
never restates its own parameter's name. ``query_for_denial(value)`` and
``raise_if_denied(value)`` remain for the rare caller holding a model id from
somewhere other than the dropdown.

Nodes that reinstall the ``Options`` trait themselves (e.g. after a driver
disconnect) call ``reinstall_options()`` to put the component's trait +
decoration + badge back in place.

Composition (not inheritance) is deliberate. Three reasons:

1. **Base class diversity.** The candidate node set inherits from at least
   4 different bases -- ``ControlNode``, ``GriptapeProxyNode`` (3 levels deep
   over ``SuccessFailureNode(BaseNode)``), and config-node bases. A mixin
   would force an MRO on every consumer and collide with existing hierarchies
   (especially ``GriptapeProxyNode``'s). Composition is base-class-agnostic.
2. **Namespace hygiene.** A mixin adds ~7 public methods (``refresh``,
   ``on_value_changed``, ``query_for_denial``, ``raise_if_denied``, etc.) to
   the node's public surface. ``refresh`` in particular is a common name that
   could clash with existing node methods. Composition keeps them scoped to
   ``self._model_access.foo(...)``.
3. **Multiple instances per node.** A node with two model-selection
   parameters (a prompt model + an image model, for example) trivially holds
   two component instances. A mixin can't be instantiated twice on one class.

        either problem raises at construction.

        A legacy value is accepted wherever it is assigned -- the ``Options``
        trait's ``choices`` include it -- but migrated to its canonical choice

        - ``parameter`` must not already carry an ``Options`` or ``Button``
          trait. Adding a second ``Options`` results in an ambiguous dropdown;
          adding a second ``Button`` overloads the refresh row. Migrate the
          node to construct the parameter without those traits and let the
          component add them.
        - ``default_model`` must be one of ``model_choices``. In particular it
          may not be a ``deprecated_values`` key: legacy keys are not real
          provider ids, so they never appear in the access verdicts and would
