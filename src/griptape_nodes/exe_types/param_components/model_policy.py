"""Shared license-policy layer for model-selection parameters.

Two components put model dropdowns on nodes: ``ModelAccessComponent`` decorates a *static*
dropdown whose choices a library author enumerated, and ``HuggingFaceModelParameter`` builds its
choices by scanning the local HuggingFace cache. They differ entirely in how they own the
``Parameter`` -- traits, ``ui_options`` keys, refresh timing -- and deliberately do not compose.

They do not differ in what "is this model permitted?" means. That question is this module: query
the policy layer once, hold the verdicts in an immutable snapshot, and answer lookups from it. Both
components delegate here so a policy change lands in one place and the two surfaces cannot drift
into giving opposite answers for the same model.

Every node-attributed query is built by ``node_access_request``, including the live per-value
re-asks a component makes at run time. Asking about a node means naming both the node type and the
library it came from -- see that function -- and one construction point is what keeps the second
half from being forgotten.

What stays with each component: installing traits, writing ``ui_options``, deciding when to
refresh, and choosing how a denial reaches the artist (row icon, badge, raised error).

    """The result of one ``QueryModelAccessForNodeRequest``, as an immutable unit.

    Frozen and replaced wholesale by ``query_model_policy()``, so the tables cannot drift apart:
    there is no window where denials describe one query and declared ids another.

    All three tables are keyed by ``provider_model_id`` -- the upstream provider's name for the
    model -- because that is the handle a dropdown value can be reduced to.
    ``denial_by_provider_id`` holds only what policy denied; ``catalog_ids_by_provider_id`` maps
    every resolved handle to the stable catalog keys policy gates on;
    ``display_name_by_provider_id`` maps it to the catalog's readable name, for decorating a row a
    person reads.

    That key is deliberately NOT unique: ``Model``'s contract allows two catalog entries to describe
    the same ``provider_model_id`` with different ``key_support`` (e.g. a BYOK entry and a
    hosted-key entry). So a denial on ANY entry sharing a handle denies the handle, and
    ``catalog_ids_for`` returns every catalog id behind it rather than whichever was seen last --
    otherwise the permitted twin of a denied entry would let the denied one run. That is also why
    there is exactly one catalog table rather than a handle-to-single-id map beside it: a second
    table holding "whichever entry was seen first" would be the shape this one exists to replace,
    and keeping both invites an edit that updates one and not the other.

    ``display_name_by_provider_id`` is a handle-to-single-value map, which is the shape the
    paragraph above rejects, and it is safe only because a name decides nothing. It keeps the first
    name declared for a shared handle: there is no any-wins rule to inherit, because a name is not a
    verdict, and picking the "wrong" twin's name changes how a row reads rather than what may run.
    A name must never be used as an identity -- what a dropdown stores and what a payload sends is
    the handle itself.

    ``failure_detail`` is set when the engine could not answer at all (unregistered node class,
    missing manifest declaration). Both tables are then empty, and a caller must not read "no
    denials known" as "no denials" -- see ``denial_for``.

    ``has_unmatchable_entries`` is True when a resolved model declared no ``provider_model_id``.
    Such an entry is declared but cannot be matched against a dropdown value, which makes
    ``catalog_ids_by_provider_id`` an incomplete view of the catalog. Callers that would refuse an
    unrecognized value must not do so in that case; absence proves nothing.

    ``unmatchable_denials`` names the catalog ids that policy DENIED but that carry no
    ``provider_model_id`` to match a dropdown value against. Those denials cannot be honored
    per-row, so they are honored for the whole parameter instead -- see ``denial_for``. Dropping
    them would let an explicitly forbidden model run.
