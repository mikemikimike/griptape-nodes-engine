"""Node types whose behavior is defined by a saved workflow file.

A library can declare a node in its ``workflow_nodes`` list instead of its ``nodes`` list,
pointing at a saved workflow ``.py`` that contains Start Flow and End Flow nodes. The engine
reads the workflow's saved shape and generates a node type whose inputs are the workflow's
Start Flow parameters and whose outputs are its End Flow parameters. Running the node imports
the workflow as a transient subflow, feeds the inputs in, runs it, and copies the End Flow
values back out.

The generated node types are ordinary ``BaseNode`` subclasses built by
``build_workflow_node_class``, so they behave like any other library node on the canvas.
