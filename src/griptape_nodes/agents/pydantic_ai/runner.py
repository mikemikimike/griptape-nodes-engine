"""High-level runner that wraps `pydantic_ai.Agent` for the chat sidebar.

This module is the single point of contact between the request-handling layer
(``AgentManager``) and the Pydantic AI harness. It exposes one async entry
point :meth:`PydanticAgentRunner.run` that:

  * builds (or reuses) a Pydantic AI ``Agent`` configured with the Griptape
    Cloud model, the skills capability, and any MCP servers the caller passed,
  * loads message history for the requested thread from the storage driver,
  * runs the conversation while emitting Griptape Nodes ``AgentStreamEvent``
    tokens through the supplied sink so the chat sidebar UI streams as before,
  * logs every model request, tool call, and tool result so we can debug the
    "agent stopped after planning" failure mode end-to-end,
  * persists the new message history back through the storage driver.

The runner stays framework-agnostic on purpose: it doesn't know about
``RunAgentRequest`` or the global event manager, so it's easy to test and
swap.

                inlined ``BinaryContent`` images) for multimodal input.

                consumers; use ``event_sink`` for the structured stream.

                (text deltas, tool calls, tool results, thinking deltas).

            cancel_event: When set while the run is in flight, the agent task is

                ``cancelled=True`` carrying the text streamed so far. The
                cancelled turn is not persisted.
            persist_prompt: When the live ``prompt`` inlines binary content, the
                URL-reference form to store in this turn's user message instead
                of it, keeping saved history small. ``None`` persists ``prompt``
                as-is.
            history_rehydrator: Optional async hook that returns a transformed
                copy of the loaded message history for the model call (e.g.
                re-downloading image URLs back to bytes). It MUST NOT mutate its

                so any in-place edit would leak back onto disk. ``None`` sends
                the loaded history to the model unchanged.
            extra_toolsets: Toolsets to attach to this run only, on top of the
                ones baked into the agent. Pydantic AI treats run-level toolsets
                as additive, so these do not replace ``mcp_servers``. Use this
                for toolsets whose configuration can change between runs - an
                MCP server the user just edited - so the run picks up the
                current config without rebuilding the agent.
            extra_instructions: Instructions to append for this run only, in the
                same additive spirit. Guidance that belongs to a toolset passed
                via ``extra_toolsets`` travels here, so the two stay in sync.
            extra_headers: HTTP headers to send on this run's model calls, and on
                any Griptape Cloud call a tool makes. Per run, because a value
                such as the budget attribution header follows the project open
                when the turn starts.
