"""Project-scoped packaging utility for export/import.

Mirrors WorkflowPackager (a utility managers call, NOT a manager), but operates
at project scope: it bundles a whole project base directory into a portable .zip
and reads such a .zip back. Unlike WorkflowPackager it NEVER reads or writes
secret values; only required secret KEY names travel in the manifest.

The library partition is driven entirely by the project-adjacent
griptape_nodes_config.json:
- libraries_to_download entries (git-sourced, version-pinned in config) are
  REFERENCED only: the config entry travels, source does not, and the importing
  engine re-downloads them via its normal provisioning on activation.
- libraries_to_register entries (manually registered local libraries with no
  remote source) are TRUE-COPIED into the zip's libraries/ tree, and their
  config path is rewritten to a package-relative path so it resolves at the new
  location after import.

The module splits into two units that share only the filename/schema constants:
- Export (write): the pure classification functions plus ProjectExporter, which
  bundles a loaded project into a .zip.
- Import (read): the read_manifest / extract_archive / is_manifest_schema_compatible
  / rename_project_template functions, which inspect or unpack such a .zip.
