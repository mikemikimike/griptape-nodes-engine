class ExecuteNodeRequest(RequestPayload):
    """Execute a node's aprocess() directly with provided parameter values.

    Hydrates the node's input parameters, calls aprocess(), and returns outputs.
    Unlike ResolveNodeRequest, this bypasses flow/DAG machinery and executes
    the node's process method directly.

    Handling depends on where the request lands:

    - **Orchestrator**: the node must already exist in ObjectManager. If it does
      not, the request fails; node_metadata is ignored on this path. The
      orchestrator is the sole source of truth for node identity and parameter
      values.
    - **Worker**: a fresh transient node is constructed from node_metadata on
      every call via LibraryRegistry.create_node, hydrated, run, and discarded.
      The worker never persists nodes across requests. node_metadata is
      therefore required on this path.

    Args:
        node_name: Name of the node to execute.
        parameter_values: Input parameter values to set before execution.
        node_metadata: Full node metadata from the orchestrator. Required when
            the target library spawns a worker (used to construct the transient
            worker-side node). Ignored on the orchestrator path.
        local_object_source: The orchestrator's identity for this node in the process-local object
            cache. The worker's transient node adopts it so the objects it caches land in the same slots
            across runs, and survive the node being renamed. Carried as its own field rather than inside
            node_metadata, which clients can write: two live nodes sharing one identity would make the
            second one's first cached object displace and free the first's.
        variables: Workflow variable dict for inline {VAR} substitution, computed
            by the orchestrator from VariablesManager before the request is sent.
            An empty dict means substitution is disabled or there are no variables.
            Workers carry this field because they have no access to VariablesManager
            or the workflow context; in-process nodes use it to skip the NodeManager
            lookup that would otherwise resolve the flow.
        workflow_name / workflow_file_path / workflow_working_directory: the orchestrator's workflow
            CONTEXT, which the worker adopts as its own before running the node. Sent for the same
            reason as `variables` -- it lives in in-process state only the orchestrator has -- and
            sent as context rather than as resolved paths so that everything derived from it
            (`workflow_dir`, `workflow_name`, variable-substitution enablement, anything added
            later) is answered by the worker's normal code paths. A worker without it answers "no
            current workflow" to all of them, which silently degrades `{outputs}` from the
            workflow's own folder to a workspace-relative path. These three mirror
            ContextManager.WorkflowContextState exactly; workflow_name None means the orchestrator
            had no workflow either, so there is nothing to adopt.
