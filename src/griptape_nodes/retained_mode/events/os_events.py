    Use when: A node or workflow needs to discover frame/item sequences on disk
    (e.g. a render output, a directory of dialogue takes). The engine handles
    macro resolution, the directory listing, and fileseq parsing — callers hand
    in a path or pattern and get back a Sequence whose paths are in the same
    macro shape they supplied. That makes scan results portable across machines
    where `{inputs}` may resolve to different absolute roots.

    Args:
        path: A path to a numbered file sequence. Can be:
            - A macro-form pattern: `{inputs}/render.####.png`. The macro head
              is preserved on every emitted entry path.
            - A plain absolute pattern: `/work/render.####.png`. Round-trips
              identically.
            - A literal single-file path: `/work/photo.png`. Behavior when the
              filename has no sequence token is controlled by
              `no_token_behavior` (see below).
            Sequence tokens (`####`, `%04d`, `@@@`, `$F4`) may appear at most
            once and only in the filename component. Multi-token paths are
            rejected with `INVALID_TEMPLATE`.
        policy: How to handle gaps within the matched range. Defaults to `SPLIT`.
        no_token_behavior: How to handle a path with zero sequence tokens.
            `SINGLE_FILE` (default) treats the whole filename as a literal —
            one-item sequence if the file exists, empty result otherwise.
            `EXPLORE_SEQUENCE` lets fileseq read digits in the filename as an
            implicit sequence — `render.0002.png` becomes one frame of an
            inferred `render.####.png` sequence and the scan walks every
            matching sibling. `REJECT` fails with `INVALID_TEMPLATE` for
            workflows that must not silently widen the artist's intent.
        start_number: Optional lower bound (inclusive) for the active range. Items
            below this are dropped. Must be >= 0 if supplied; rejected with
            `INVALID_BOUNDS` otherwise.

      but either the padding didn't line up with the pattern's token, or
