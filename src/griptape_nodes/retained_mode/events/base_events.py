        failure_log_level: If set, override the log level for failure results.
                          Use logging.DEBUG (10) or logging.INFO (20) to suppress error toasts.
                          Default: None (use handler's default, typically ERROR).
        broadcast_result: Whether handle_request should queue the result event for broadcast
                          (e.g. to connected WebSocket clients). Defaults to True. Request types
                          whose results are large or only relevant to the direct caller can
                          default this to False on the subclass to avoid unnecessary serialization
                          and transmission. Can also be set per-instance at construction time.
        fields: **Wire-only** dot-path filter applied to the broadcast JSON before it is sent
                over the WebSocket. Has no effect on in-process/retained-mode callers, which
                always receive the full result object. Like broadcast_result and failure_log_level,
                this is a transport-layer concern, not part of the request logic.

                Syntax:
                  - ``None`` (default) — return all fields.
                  - ``[]`` (empty list) — return only framework fields (result_details,
                    altered_workflow_state). Useful to trigger side effects without caring
                    about the result payload.
                  - ``["a", "a.b.c"]`` — dot-paths select nested fields. An empty list
                    entry keeps the whole value; a more-specific sibling narrows it.
                    Prefix-wins: if both ``"workflows"`` and ``"workflows.name"`` are
                    listed, the full ``workflows`` value is kept.
                  - ``"*"`` wildcard — for ``dict[str, SomeObject]`` where keys are
                    arbitrary (e.g. file paths). ``"workflows.*.name"`` plucks ``name``
                    from each value without knowing the keys in advance. Prefer ``"*"``
                    over a concrete key for such maps: naming a specific key warns
                    "not found" whenever that key is legitimately absent.

                Framework fields (result_details, altered_workflow_state) are always
                included regardless of what fields specifies. Filtering is skipped
                entirely on failure results.
