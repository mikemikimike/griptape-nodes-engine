    Use when: Switching between workflows, initializing workflow sessions,

    Args:
        workflow_name: Name of the workflow to set as current context. When None,
                       the handler mints a fresh "unsaved:<uuid>" registry key and
                       auto-registers an unsaved entry under it. When provided and
                       starting with the unsaved-registry-key prefix ("unsaved:"),
                       the handler auto-registers a fresh unsaved entry keyed by
                       that exact value if one does not already exist.
        display_name: Human-readable name used when auto-registering an unsaved entry.
                      Ignored when the workflow is already in the registry. Defaults to
                      None; in that case the auto-registered entry gets a placeholder

                      of its own yet. `{workflow_dir}` -- and so every project directory
                      built on it, `{outputs}` among them -- answers with this until the
                      workflow is saved, at which point the saved file's own directory takes
                      over. A DIRECTORY, not a file path. Absolute paths are recommended;
                      if you supply a relative path it is anchored to the workspace directory
                      (not the project base directory, which may sit one level above). Optional:

                      would land in, read from the project's `save_workflow` situation.
