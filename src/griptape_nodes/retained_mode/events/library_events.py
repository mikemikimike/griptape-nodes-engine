    Use when: An agent has just written a `.py` file into the configured sandbox directory

    types without restarting. The engine never writes anything itself; it only registers what
    is already at `file_path`. The new node types are immediately usable via
    `CreateNodeRequest` / `CreateNodesRequest`.

    The file can be either of two kinds, told apart by its workflow metadata header:

    - Python node source (no workflow header): imported, and each `BaseNode` subclass in it is
      registered under its class name.
    - A saved workflow (a `# /// script` header with a `[tool.griptape-nodes]` table): NOT
      imported. It becomes one workflow-backed node with the workflow's Start Flow and End Flow
      parameters as inputs and outputs, named from the workflow (`shout_workflow` becomes
      `ShoutWorkflow`). It needs a Start Flow node and an End Flow node.

    The file persists on disk, so subsequent engine startups pick it up through the normal
    sandbox scan-and-load pipeline. Auto-generated metadata follows the same conventions the
    engine applies to files placed in the sandbox directory through the UI.

    Security note: imported Python node source runs inside the engine process with no
    isolation. Anyone who can reach this request, or who can write into the sandbox directory,
    can execute arbitrary Python. This mirrors the existing sandbox-directory behaviour, but
    makes that surface reachable via MCP.

        pinned_version: The download entry's PEP 440 version specifier, or None for a source-only entry.

        git_ref: The branch/tag/commit parsed from `git_url`, when present.
        destructive: True only for a git OVERWRITE (deletes the local dir).
        reason: Human-readable explanation of the decision.
