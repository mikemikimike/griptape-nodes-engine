"""Events for budget attribution.

The engine is the only party that knows which project a credit-consuming call belongs to. These
events hand a caller one ready-to-send header value. They make no network call and read no
credential; they label a call, they do not decide whether the call is allowed. Cloud decides
that, and `griptape_nodes.utils.budget_refusal` turns its refusal into something an artist can
act on.

    of the project name, replaceable with any string, and a filesystem path on a project created
    before ids existed -- and all of it is visible to an SSL-inspecting egress proxy.

    Best-effort: nothing here raises. Not knowing which project to bill is not a reason to refuse
    work -- the spend is legitimate, it just lands unattributed. A chain that cannot be read
    yields a Failure rather than an empty chain, which would assert that no project is open.

    Use when: A node or driver is about to make a credit-consuming call and wants the spend
    attributed to the project the user is working in.
