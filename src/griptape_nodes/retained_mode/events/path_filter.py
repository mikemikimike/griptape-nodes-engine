"""Dot-path field projection for WebSocket result payloads.

Used by EventResult.dict() to prune the unstructured result dict before broadcast.
Frontend callers set RequestPayload.fields to shrink the wire payload; the converter
still materializes the full result in memory — only transmission is reduced.

Path mini-language
------------------
- "a.b.c"  — keep field b.c nested inside a
- "*"       — wildcard: apply subtree to every value in a dict with arbitrary keys
              (e.g. dict[str, WorkflowMetadata] keyed by file path). Use "*" — not a
              concrete key — for such maps: referencing a specific key (e.g.
              "situations.save_file") on an arbitrary-key map warns "not found" whenever
              that key is legitimately absent, since keys are indistinguishable from typos.
- Prefix-wins: if both "workflows" and "workflows.name" are requested, "workflows" wins.
- Unmatched paths at any depth emit a WARNING (typo vs version skew).
- Mixing "*" with named siblings at the same level emits a WARNING; named keys are dropped.
