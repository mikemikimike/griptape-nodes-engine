    A "sequence slot" is a variable whose ``format_specs`` contains a
    ``SequenceFormat`` — emitted by ``{###}`` / ``{###?}`` shorthand in the
    macro template. Optional slots (``{###?}``) that aren't bound are always
    omitted by the resolver, so this enum only takes effect on a required
    ``{###}`` slot with no value in the ``variables`` dict.

    Values:
        FAIL — default. Return ``GetPathForMacroResultFailure`` with
            ``MISSING_REQUIRED_VARIABLES``. This is what the write path (via
            ``on_write_file_request``) wants: the failure is the signal the
            seed-and-retry logic uses to auto-allocate the first index.
        RENDER_SEQUENCE_PATTERN — render the slot as its bare hash glyphs
            (``###``, ``####``, ...) into the resolved path — the ffmpeg /
            Houdini / Nuke convention that reads universally as "digits go
            here." **Presentation only.** The output previews the eventual
            on-disk shape of the path (a saved file becomes e.g.
            ``render_v001.png``); it is NOT a valid filesystem path itself
            and must not be opened, written, or handed to any I/O primitive.
            Use when showing users a preview of the macro shape (e.g. UI
            destination fields, path-classification previews).
        START_AT_ZERO — seed the slot with ``0`` and render it (``000``
            at min_width=3). Useful for 0-indexed preview flows.
        START_AT_ONE — seed the slot with ``1`` and render it (``001`` at
            min_width=3). Matches the write-path seed's starting value,
            so this is the right choice when previewing "what would my

    """Find out if an absolute path exists anywhere within a Project directory.

    Use when: User selects or types an absolute path via FilePicker and you need to know:
      1. Is this path inside any project directory?
      2. If yes, what's the macro form (e.g., {outputs}/file.png)?

    This enables automatic conversion of absolute paths to portable macro form for workflow portability.

    Uses longest prefix matching to find the most specific directory match.
    Returns Success with mapped_path if inside project, or Success with None if outside.
    Returns Failure if operation cannot be performed (no project loaded, secrets unavailable).

    Args:
        absolute_path: The absolute filesystem path to check
        project_id: Which project's directories to map against. None means the
            current project. Passing a loaded-but-not-current project id supports
            hypothetical mapping ("would this path be inside project Y?").
