        each project's effective libraries root on the project listing. Previously each open-coded
        `resolve_workspace_path(Path(...), configured_global_workspace_path())`, which is exactly
        the kind of duplication that lets a preview or a UI hint drift from what activation does.

        The base is deliberately configured_global_workspace_path() -- the ENGINE's workspace,
        excluding the runtime per-project override -- so this answer does NOT depend on which
        project happens to be active. That is what makes it safe to compute for a project that is
        not loaded. `libraries_directory` is the caller's business: it must come from the TARGET
        project's config layers, not the merged view of whatever project is open.

        A missing or empty value falls back to DEFAULT_LIBRARIES_DIRECTORY here rather than at each
        call site: a caller that forgot its own default would otherwise hand us None and resolve the
        libraries root to the workspace itself (`Path("")` is `Path(".")`), quietly installing
        libraries on top of the user's workspace.

        Args:
            libraries_directory: The `libraries_directory` config value (absolute, or relative to
                the global workspace). Anything that is not a non-empty string means "not
                configured" -- None and "" say so deliberately, and a non-string says it by
                accident. The annotation names what callers SHOULD pass, not the full set of what
                arrives: the value comes from user-editable config JSON, where nothing enforces the
                type, so `get_config_value` can hand over an int or a list.

        Returns:
            The absolute directory libraries install and resolve under.

        variables in that field, and env vars are the only substitution it accepts -- `{macro}` tokens
        are refused there because building the macro bag needs the very values those fields produce.

        Publishes `default_libraries_root`, NOT `resolved_libraries_root`. The latter returns
        `_libraries_root_override` when a project declares or inherits a libraries_dir, so publishing
        it would make the variable's value depend on the field that reads it. The default is derived

        Called once from __init__, deliberately not from load_configs(), which re-runs on every
        project activation -- by which point the override may be set, reintroducing that circularity.
        The consequence to keep in mind: this reflects the config layers present at boot (env vars,
        user config, defaults), so a project-adjacent or workspace config that re-points
        libraries_directory at activation time is NOT retroactively published here.

        The value must be in place before any project YAML is read, because a project naming an unset
        variable is refused at load time and becomes unusable. __init__ runs when the Engine builds
        its managers, well before projects load in on_app_initialization_complete.

        An existing value is overwritten rather than preserved. This is a published value, so a stale
        one left in the shell would make the variable lie about where this engine installs libraries;
        the supported ways to move that location are the libraries_directory config value and a

        The prefix case is last because it only has to separate overrides that are each valid on
        their own. Exporting both GTN_CONFIG_ARTIFACTS__IMAGE and
        GTN_CONFIG_ARTIFACTS__IMAGE__PREVIEW_FORMAT asks for `artifacts.image` to be a value and a
        section at once, and `dict[str, Any]` accepts either, so something has to break the tie:
        `set_dot_value` would otherwise honor whichever `os.environ` yielded last. The deeper path
        wins because it carries strictly more of what was asked for. An override that fails
        validation is not competing for anything, so it must be dropped before the tie is broken;
        judging overlap first would let a typo like GTN_CONFIG_AGENT__SYSTEM_PROMPT__OOPS take a
        correct neighbour down with it.

        the more specific explanation:

        1. A higher-priority layer also defines what was written and keeps winning the merge.
        2. The open project pins `workspace_directory` to the value the config stack supplied it,

        3. The merged result failed `Settings` validation, so `load_configs` discarded it.

        Ownership is judged before values are compared, because writing the value a higher layer
        already holds is still not a write that took effect: the user's copy is inert and the next
        remerge keeps reporting the other layer's.

        Judged on the keys the caller actually wrote, which for a dict `value` means its leaves
        rather than `key` itself: writing `{"port": 8080}` to category "nuke" is unaffected by a
        project layer that defines only "nuke.executable".
