#
# A ProjectID is an opaque, unique-per-engine identifier. The UI sets a GUID by
# default, but a user may set any unique string. Consumers must NOT parse or
# construct it (e.g. by canonicalizing it as a path): it is matched verbatim
# against the registry. Legacy projects that predate the explicit `id` field use
# the canonicalized project file path string as their id (the legacy bridge), so
# the id-space is mixed (GUID/custom ids, legacy path-string ids, and the
# synthetic SYSTEM_DEFAULTS_KEY). The on-disk file path is a separate locator.
# ProjectID lives in project_events (payloads annotate with it and pydantic needs the name
# resolvable at runtime); re-exported here because this module is where most callers look.

        a path -- an unset `${VAR}` / `%VAR%`, a `{macro}` token, or a per-platform mapping with no
        entry for this OS and no `default` -- is an error, because the only alternative is to discard
        what the user wrote and put their workspace or their libraries somewhere else.

        The error's blast radius differs by field. A broken `parent_project_path` is UNUSABLE: the
        template cannot be merged with a base that cannot be found, so there is nothing coherent to
        load. A broken `workspace_dir` or `libraries_dir` is a RECOVERABLE error (FLAWED): the

        Parent links have two forms, checked in this precedence order:

        1. `parent_project_id` (preferred, portable): the parent is located via the
           engine registry (id -> file path), so the link survives moving the file
           between machines. If the id is not registered on this engine, resolution
           fails closed (records an error and returns None). `parent_project_path` is
           ignored entirely when an id is present.
        2. `parent_project_path` (legacy, back-compat): the parent YAML is located by
           filesystem path. A relative path resolves against the directory of
           `project_file_path` so a child can name its parent with a relative path
           (e.g. `parent_project_path: ../base/griptape-nodes-project.yml`). A
           per-platform mapping is reduced to the active OS's path first; a mapping
           with no key for this OS and no `default` names no parent this engine can
           find, which is an error like any other unresolvable path field.
        3. Neither set: the base is `DEFAULT_PROJECT_TEMPLATE`.

        Once the parent file path is located, the parent YAML is read, recursively
        resolved, merged onto its own ancestors, and returned as the base for the
        caller. Macro tokens are rejected by the loader; only absolute or relative
        paths reach the path-based branch.

        Cycle detection: `visited` carries the canonical Paths of every project file
        that is currently being resolved further down the chain. A cycle records an
        error on `validation` and returns None.

        Errors during parent resolution (missing file, unregistered id, unparsable
        YAML, cycle) are recorded on the child's `validation` and surfaced to the
        caller as a None return.

        Every ancestor the walk resolves is appended to `resolved_ancestors` instead of
        being registered here, because whether they should be registered depends on what
        the caller does next. A caller that goes on to cache its own project passes the
        list to `_commit_resolved_ancestors`; a caller that bails, or only needed a merge
        base, discards it.

        Priority, highest first (matching _activate_project's block):

        0. the project template's own workspace_dir field (passed in already resolved to an
           absolute path via _resolve_template_workspace_dir) -> (template dir, apply_override=True)
        1. project_workspaces user-config override, keyed by project ID or path ->
           (override dir, apply_override=True)
        2. workspace_directory from env vars -> (env dir, apply_override=False)
        3. workspace_directory from the project-adjacent config -> (project dir, apply_override=False)
        4. the nearest ancestor's resolved workspace, walking the explicit parent-project chain ->
           (ancestor workspace, apply_override=True)
        5. the global configured workspace_directory, else the project's own directory (auto-default)
           -> (configured root or project dir, apply_override=True)

        `template_workspace_dir` is the highest-priority source: a project that declares its own
        workspace_dir beats the per-user project_workspaces mapping and the env var. The caller
        resolves the (possibly per-platform, possibly relative) raw field to an absolute path before
        passing it, so this method and the offline resolver share the branch verbatim. None must mean
        the field was ABSENT and nothing more: a declared value that cannot produce a path loads as
        FLAWED, and every path to this ladder gates on that first (activation via
        unresolvable_declared_path_messages, the offline resolvers and the listing via
        `is_unresolvable`), so branch 0 is skipped only when the project genuinely declares no
        workspace of its own.

        Branch 4 walks the project's explicit parent chain (parent_project_id / legacy
        parent_project_path, resolved through the registry) and inherits the first ancestor that
        resolves a workspace via its own override mapping or project-adjacent config. This makes a
        derived project with no workspace of its own inherit its parent's workspace instead of
        treating its own subdir as a fresh workspace (which would resolve libraries_directory to an
        empty libraries/ tree and wrongly prompt to reinstall already downloaded libraries). It only
        fires when no explicit workspace was named above, so a project-adjacent workspace_directory
        (branch 3) still wins and a sidecar config remains a full opt-out at every level of the
        chain. See _inherit_workspace_from_parents.

        Branch 5's global default is unconditional: when the chain is exhausted with no ancestor
        workspace, the configured workspace_directory is used regardless of where the project file
        sits on disk, so an imported standalone project with no ancestor workspace adopts the global
        workspace. The final own-directory fallback only fires when workspace_directory is unset in
        both config layers; in a real engine the Settings default always populates default_config, so
        this is a defensive path exercised only by tests that mock both layers to None.

        `apply_override` is True only for the override-mapping, parent-inheritance, and global-default
        branches, because those are the cases where activation calls set_workspace_override. For env
        or project-adjacent workspace_directory, activation leaves the override unset so the
        workspace config layer can re-point the final workspace_path; a forced override
        would mask that. Both _activate_project (live) and the provisioning preview drive
        off this one decision, so the previewed library/engine_version plan and what
        reconcile_libraries_from_config actually does cannot drift.

        Branches 1-3 and 4-result/5 are factored into _decide_workspace_pre_inheritance and
        _decide_workspace_post_inheritance so resolve_workspace_dir_for_project_id (which resolves an
        unloaded project) shares them verbatim, differing only in how `inherited` is produced (the
        live registry walk here vs. an offline disk walk there).

        deciding relative-vs-absolute and anchors a still-relative path to the DECLARING project's
        directory. Mirrors how parent_project_path is resolved (_resolve_parent_chain), so all three
        path fields treat relative paths and variables identically.

        This is the single source of truth for both fields; _resolve_template_workspace_dir and
        _resolve_template_libraries_dir are `str | None` projections of it for the resolution
        ladders, which only need "is there a usable value?".

        An unset field resolves to a None path with no failure state -- "nothing declared", so the
        ladder falls through to the next source.

        A field that IS declared but cannot produce a path (no entry for this platform and no
        'default', an unset variable, a macro token) comes back with `is_unresolvable` set. A
        project in that state loads as FLAWED (_read_overlay records the problem instead of refusing
        the overlay), so this outcome IS reachable for loaded projects: activation refuses it
        (the gate at the top of _activate_project), the ancestor walks report it as a break in the
        chain, and the listing shows the affected path as unknown. Only the `str | None` projections
        collapse it to "nothing" -- their callers must gate on `is_unresolvable` first when a
        substitute location would be user-visible.

        One window where load-time and activation-time answers can differ: a project registered
        WHILE another project's `environment:` block is applied validates against that mutated
        os.environ, whereas activation restores the launch environment before resolving. A value
        that depends on a variable only some other project sets can therefore load as GOOD and
        still be refused at activation, or vice versa; both re-resolve rather than trusting the
        load-time verdict.

        this shares _decide_workspace_from_disk with the provisioning preview so the two cannot drift.
        A parentless project has no inheritance to resolve, so it takes the sync decide_workspace /
        decide_libraries_root path and pays no disk I/O.

        apply_override is preserved verbatim: True for the project_workspaces mapping, parent-chain
        inheritance, and global-default branches; False for an env/project-adjacent workspace_directory
        (so the override stays unset and the workspace config layer can re-point workspace_path). A None
        libraries root clears the override so a stale one from a previously-active sharing project is

        A within-major advance happens automatically on save; this performs the explicit,
        opt-in crossing of a major boundary so the project ADOPTS the new major's defaults.

        It re-reads the project's own on-disk OVERLAY (its explicit customizations only -- NOT
        the merged template, whose inherited fields were materialized to the old-major values at
        load), restamps that overlay to the latest version, and re-merges it onto the new-major

        layout can change, which is exactly the point of crossing a major.

        latest major (or an unparsable version), the overlay can't be re-read, the parent chain is

           template that anchors saves outside the workspace root is answered with its folder
