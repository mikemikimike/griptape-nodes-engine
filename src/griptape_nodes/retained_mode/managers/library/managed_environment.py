"""Environment mode: the libraries the environment provides, and the rules that hold while it does.

When `library.provisioned_by` is 'environment', the environment the engine was started in decides
which libraries load (`GTN_LIBRARY_PATHS`) and holds their packages. The engine then loads nothing
else and downloads, updates, and builds nothing. The request handlers refuse those changes with an
artist-readable message; `ensure_engine_provisions` backs that up at the shared helpers that do the
work, so a handler that forgets its own check still cannot download, build, or install.
