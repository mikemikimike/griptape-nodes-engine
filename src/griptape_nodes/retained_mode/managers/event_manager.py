# dispatches -- which is exactly the lineage meant to be hidden -- and is invisible to any task
# or thread the engine did not spawn from inside the window.

        """Register a callback to run after `request_type`'s handler has produced a result.

        The callback receives `(request, result)`. Whenever the engine has a live event
        loop it is scheduled as a detached task, so it does not delay the result reaching
        the caller and may run as long as it needs. On paths with no live engine loop --
        CLI commands, bootstrap workflow runs, worker threads -- there is nothing to
        detach onto, so the hook runs inline and *does* block the dispatching caller
        until it finishes. Sync and async callbacks are both accepted. Registering the
        same callback object twice for the same request type is a no-op.

        The callback is notification-only -- it cannot alter the result or fail the
        operation, because the result has already been returned. Specifically:

        - It fires for both success and failure results, including when the handler
          raised (in that case the payload is the `GenericResultFailure` synthesized for
          the client).
        - `request` and `result` must be treated as read-only. The same `request` object
          is referenced by the result event still queued for the client, so mutating it
          corrupts what the client sees.
        - Fields marked `omit_from_result` are already `None` on the request the callback
          sees. That scrub exists to keep sensitive and bulky values out of results, so
          it is deliberately not undone for hooks.
        - Matching is on the exact request type; subclasses of `request_type` do not
          fire it.
        - There is no ordering guarantee relative to the result reaching the client, nor
          between separate invocations of the same hook.
        - Hooks run regardless of `request.broadcast_result` or event suppression.
        - A raising callback is logged and ignored; it does not stop sibling callbacks.
        - Callbacks must not issue engine requests. Any hook already running further up
          the same chain is skipped rather than recursing, but requests from a hook also
          perturb operation-depth tracking for concurrent requests.

        Async callbacks run on the engine event loop (or, on the inline path, a transient
        loop that may itself be on another thread) and must not block it. Sync callbacks are handed to a
        worker thread, so blocking in one cannot stall the loop -- but that thread comes
        from the loop's default executor, which is shared with every other `to_thread`
        caller in the engine. Because hook tasks are unbounded, a slow sync hook firing on
        a high-frequency request type can occupy the pool and make unrelated engine work
        that also needs a thread queue behind it. Keep sync callbacks quick.

    The operations themselves complete normally: suppression only skips queueing the broadcast,
    and in-process callers still receive every result in full.

    Suppression applies to the current context and to any nested request dispatched from inside
    the block, not to the manager as a whole -- see ``_suppressed_event_types`` for why that
    distinction is load-bearing. Nesting composes: the previous value is restored on exit, so an
    inner block adding a type does not unsuppress what an outer block was already hiding.

    One instance may be entered more than once, whether nested in itself or reused for a later
    block. Tokens are therefore kept on a stack rather than in a single field: with one field, a
    second ``__enter__`` overwrites the outer block's token, and the outer ``__exit__`` has nothing
    left to restore -- so the suppressed set stays in place for the rest of the context. Nothing
    would report it, and it fails in the harmful direction: over-broadcasting is cosmetic, a
