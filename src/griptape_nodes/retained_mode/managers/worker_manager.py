        Concurrent, and bounded per worker. Serially, a worker that is merely SLOW -- adoption runs a
        full library reload, which can include installs -- kept every worker behind it from even
        receiving the request, so the caller waited out the sum rather than the slowest. And

        evicts a SILENT worker and says nothing about a busy one, so a user-facing switch could wait
        forever. The bound is the startup grace, the same budget a worker's own slow startup gets.

        not affect the others; the caller decides what a failure means.
