"""Chat-sidebar agent manager backed by the Pydantic AI harness.

This manager owns:

  * the lifecycle of a per-process :class:`PydanticAgentRunner` that talks to
    Griptape Cloud through its OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint,
  * the local thread storage backend that persists Pydantic AI message
    history,
  * the existing engine-bundled MCP server (started here as a background
    thread, just like before),
  * the same request handlers the chat sidebar already calls
    (``RunAgentRequest``, ``ConfigureAgentRequest``, the thread CRUD set,
    ``GetConversationMemoryRequest``, ``ListAgentModelsRequest``).

The Griptape ``Agent`` and the JSON-output parsing dance it required are gone.
Streaming tokens come straight off Pydantic AI's text deltas via the runner's
``token_sink`` callback and land on the UI as ``AgentStreamEvent`` payloads.
