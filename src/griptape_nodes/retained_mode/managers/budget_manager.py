"""BudgetManager - Describes which project an outbound call should be attributed to.

Holds no state: the project chain is read from the project manager per request, so a project
switch between two calls shows up on the second. This module makes no network call and reads no
credential; it labels a call, it does not decide whether the call is allowed. Cloud decides that,
and `griptape_nodes.utils.budget_refusal` turns its refusal into something an artist can act on.

Project ids travel exactly as stored -- unstripped, uncut, never repaired.

The header value stays out of `result_details`, which is logged. That is all this module can do
about disclosure: `broadcast_result` is a field any caller can flip, post-dispatch hooks see the
full result, and worker forwarding puts the Success payload on the response topic.
