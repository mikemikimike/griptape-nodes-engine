"""Hooks for running the engine inside an environment another tool has prepared.

A studio can start the engine inside an environment its own tools resolve (a package manager, a
container, a launcher). Three hooks let that environment, rather than the engine, decide what runs:

- `GTN_LIBRARY_PATHS` lists library manifests the environment provides. They register like
  `libraries_to_register` entries, ahead of them.
- `library.provisioned_by = "environment"` stops the engine from building virtual
  environments or downloading libraries, and limits loading to the libraries the environment lists.
- `worker.command_prefix` puts words in front of each worker's command, so a worker can be started
  inside the environment its library needs. `{library_request}` is filled from
  `GTN_LIBRARY_WORKER_REQUESTS`.

Nothing here knows which tool prepared the environment.

    When the prefix uses `{library_request}` and the library has no entry, the environment has not

    A prefix that is configured but unusable (`prefix.problem`) also refuses the worker in
    environment mode, for the same reason: starting it without the prefix the studio meant to use
    would run the library on the editor's own environment. When the engine provisions libraries,
