"""Engine beta features: experimental behavior users can turn on or off.

Every engine beta feature is registered in this module so they are easy to audit. Values live in
the config under `beta_features.<id>`, the same map the editor's Beta settings page writes, and
`ListBetaFeaturesRequest` is how the editor discovers the features registered here.

Register a feature at module level and check it where behavior diverges:

    PARALLEL_BRANCH_RESOLUTION = register_beta_feature(
        BetaFeature(
            id="parallel_branch_resolution",
            name="Parallel branch resolution",
            description="Runs independent branches of a flow at the same time instead of one after another.",
            owner="@some-engine-dev",
            remove_by=date(2027, 1, 31),
        )
    )

    if is_beta_enabled(PARALLEL_BRANCH_RESOLUTION, self.engine.config_manager):
        ...

`is_beta_enabled` also applies the editor's global switch, `beta_features.enabled`, so always check
features through it rather than reading their config values directly.

`tests/unit/retained_mode/test_beta_features.py` fails once a feature passes its `remove_by` date
or sets one more than 180 days out. See the "Beta features" section of CLAUDE.md.

Node libraries declare their own features in the `beta_features` list of their library JSON.
`parse_library_beta_features` turns those entries into `BetaFeature`s tagged with the library's
name, whose values live under `library_beta_features.<library slug>.<id>`.
