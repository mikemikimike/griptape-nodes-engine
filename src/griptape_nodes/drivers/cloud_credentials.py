"""Resolve the credential used to authenticate against Griptape Cloud.

Griptape Cloud accepts two kinds of bearer credential: a Griptape Cloud API key
(``GT_CLOUD_API_KEY``, a ``gt-`` prefixed key) and a Griptape Nodes License
(``GRIPTAPE_NODES_LICENSE``, a JWT the desktop app writes into the engine's
global ``.env``). A license-only user has no API key at all, so any code path
that reads ``GT_CLOUD_API_KEY`` directly is unreachable for them.

Endpoints that accept a License, via the control plane's ``LicenseAuthMixin``:

- ``POST /api/v1/chat/completions`` (the sidebar agent's chat model)
- ``POST /api/images/generations`` (the agent's image-generation tool)
- ``/api/buckets*`` and ``/api/assets*`` (cloud storage and static files)
- ``GET /api/organizations``
- the model proxy (``/api/proxy/*``), which the standard library already handles
  in its own ``resolve_proxy_api_key``

Two endpoints must keep using the API key and must NOT be routed through here:

- ``GET /api/users`` has no ``LicenseAuthMixin``, so it answers a License with
  HTTP 401. Were one added, an unassigned license authenticates as the org's
  synthetic service principal, so "who is the current user" would answer with a
  service account rather than the human.
- ``wss://api.nodes.griptape.ai/ws/engines/events`` is served by a different
  service that accepts only ``gt-`` keys or Auth0-signed JWTs. A License is
  signed by the license key, so it fails signing-key lookup there.

Authenticating with a License is necessary but not always sufficient: the
control plane also evaluates an entitlement policy per request, so a License
that authenticates can still be refused with HTTP 403. See
:data:`POLICY_DENIED_HINT`.

    GT_CLOUD_API_KEY"), and the engine does not read its ``GT_CLOUD_PROXY_BASE_URL``
