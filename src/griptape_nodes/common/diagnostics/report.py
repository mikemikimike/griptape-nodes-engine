A serializable snapshot of everything about an engine worth knowing when something has gone
wrong: what version is running, on what machine, with which settings from which files, which
libraries loaded and which failed, and where the logs are.

Schema-versioned so a support tool can read a report from an older engine. Every value has
already passed through ``Redactor``, and the redaction counts travel with it.
