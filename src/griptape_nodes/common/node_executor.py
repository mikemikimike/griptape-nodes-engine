        """Keep editors from ever hearing about the nodes inside a packaged loop body.

        A loop body is rebuilt into a transient child flow on every run and torn down
        afterwards. Each rebuild dispatches a nested CreateNodeRequest whose success result
        names that transient flow, and an editor that receives it turns around and asks the
        engine for the flow's details -- by which time the flow is gone, so the artist gets an
        error toast naming a flow they never made. Marking the creation commands non-broadcast
        keeps the rebuild entirely inside the engine: in-process callers still get the full
        result, only the queued broadcast is skipped.

        Call this at the boundary that deserializes in-process, not at the one that packages.
        Generated workflow files are emitted by reflecting over each create command's non-default
        fields (WorkflowCodeGenerator._generate_node_creation_code), so a command carrying
        broadcast_result=False writes that transport detail into the saved artifact. Packaging runs
        before the execution-environment branch, and the private and cloud-publisher branches hand
        the very same serialized_flow_commands to SaveWorkflowFileFromSerializedFlowRequest -- so
        silencing at packaging time reaches a file on disk, and on the publisher branch a file in a
        library. The local deserialization sites are the only ones that both need the flag and never
        save; they also already own the EventSuppressionContext window that backs this up, which
        puts the two halves of the fix in one place.

        The mutation is in place and permanent for the lifetime of the package_result, which is safe
        here only because these callers do not save it.
