"""Strict-mode enforcement framework.

Strict mode is a runtime contract for what node code is allowed to do
across the orchestrator/worker split. This module owns scope, severity
resolution, and violation reporting -- and nothing else.

One kind of strict-mode scope exists: ``RUNTIME_EXECUTE``, which opens
around ``NodeManager.on_execute_node_request`` for a single node's
execution.

Detectors live at their own call sites (e.g. ``EventManager.handle_request``,
``BaseNode.add_parameter``) and import the module-level singleton
``STRICT_MODE`` to record violations:

    from griptape_nodes.common.strict_mode import STRICT_MODE
    STRICT_MODE.report(rule_id=..., message=...)

Severity is picked per-rule by the reporter's severity resolver:
correctness rules fail on both sides, ergonomics rules warn on the
orchestrator and escalate to ERROR on the worker. Callers that need to
escalate a worker violation (e.g. convert ``ExecuteNodeResultSuccess``
to a failure) inspect the scope's ``violations`` list after exit.

"Am I currently constructing a node?" and "What request is currently
being dispatched?" are NOT owned here. Those facts belong to
``LibraryRegistry`` and ``EventManager`` respectively; detectors
consult those subsystems directly.
