This module is the engine's only use of pickle, and every workaround pickle-era data needs lives
here. Delete it, and the fallbacks that call it, to stop reading that data.

Unpickling builds only classes the value codec can build, and imports only modules that are
already loaded or belong to griptape or griptape_nodes, so a payload cannot call arbitrary
