# Contributing to Griptape Nodes

We welcome contributions to the Griptape Nodes project! Whether it's bug fixes, new features, or documentation improvements, your help is appreciated.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine.git
    cd griptape-nodes-engine
    ```

1. **Install `uv`:**
    If you don't have `uv` installed, follow the official instructions: [Astral's uv Installation Guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

1. **Install Dependencies:**
    Use `uv` to create a virtual environment and install all required dependencies, including base, development, testing, and documentation tools:

    ```shell
    uv sync --all-groups --all-extras
    ```

    Or use the Makefile shortcut:

    ```shell
    make install
    ```

    This command reads the `pyproject.toml` file and installs everything needed for development within a `.venv` directory.

## Running Your Local Engine

This repository is the open-source Griptape Nodes **engine**, published to PyPI as `griptape-nodes-engine`. The engine contains the core workflow orchestration logic and state management.

The application that launches an engine is the `griptape-nodes` package on PyPI, which owns the CLI and communication layer for connecting clients.

To test your engine changes, run the published `griptape-nodes` app with your local engine checkout layered over it as an editable install. The quickest way is the Makefile target, which launches the app from this checkout and overlays your local engine source:

```shell
make run
```

This pulls the published app into a cached ephemeral environment and imports the engine from this checkout's `src` directory, so engine edits are reflected immediately with no reinstall. Pass arguments through `ARGS`, e.g. `make run ARGS=init` to trigger the initial setup prompts. Use `make run/refresh` to pull the latest published app first.

### Debugging in VS Code

VS Code's debugger needs a stable Python interpreter path on disk to inject `debugpy` into. The `make run` / `uvx` flow above creates an ephemeral environment per invocation and is not suitable; use the **persistent** `uv tool install` flow described below instead.

1. From the repo root, install the published app with this checkout layered as the editable engine (one time):

    ```shell
    uv tool install griptape-nodes --python 3.12 --with-editable . --force
    ```

    This populates `~/.local/share/uv/tools/griptape-nodes/` with the app and a `.pth` file pointing back at this checkout's `src/`. Both the `gtn` command and the VS Code debug configuration reuse that interpreter, so breakpoints in `src/griptape_nodes/...` bind against your local source.

1. Open the **Run and Debug** panel in VS Code, select **Python Debugger: Run Griptape Nodes Engine (persistent gtn tool)**, and press F5. The configuration in `.vscode/launch.json` invokes `python -m griptape_nodes` against the tool venv's interpreter and sets `cwd` to the workspace root so the local `griptape_nodes_config.json` (see [Configuration for Development](#configuration-for-development)) is picked up — without it, local libraries will not register under the debugger.

The configuration assumes the default `uv` tools location. If you've set `UV_TOOL_DIR` to a non-default path, edit the `python` field in `.vscode/launch.json` to match.

### Persistent `gtn` on your `PATH`

For a persistent `gtn` (or `griptape-nodes`) command on your `PATH`, install the app as a `uv` tool with the editable engine layer instead:

```shell
uv tool install griptape-nodes --python 3.12 --with-editable /path/to/griptape-nodes-engine --force
```

That creates a persistent tool venv containing the published app, plus a `.pth` file pointing at this checkout's `src` directory. Every subsequent `gtn` invocation imports the engine from your local source. This variant also guarantees that worker engine subprocesses pick up your local source.

To switch back to the engine bundled with the published app, reinstall without the editable layer:

```shell
uv tool install griptape-nodes --force
```

To upgrade the published app while keeping the local engine layer, re-run the install command with `--with-editable` and `--force`.

**Key Development Commands:**

- **Run the Engine:** Launch from this checkout:

    ```shell
    make run
    ```

- **Run Initialization:** To trigger the initial setup prompts (API Key, Workspace Directory):

    ```shell
    make run ARGS=init
    ```

- **Run Unit Tests:**

    ```shell
    uv run pytest test/unit
    ```

    Or use the Makefile shortcut:

    ```shell
    make test/unit
    ```

    > Other test targets (e.g. `tests/integration` and `tests/workflow`) require
    > a `.env` in the repo root with all keys found in `.env.example` to run.

- **Check Code (Linting & Formatting):**

    ```shell
    uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format . --check && uv run pyright
    ```

    Or use the Makefile shortcut:

    ```shell
    make check
    ```

- **Format Code:**

    ```shell
    uv run ruff format .
    ```

    Or use the Makefile shortcut:

    ```shell
    make format
    ```

- **Fix Code Automatically (Format + Lint):**

    ```shell
    uv run ruff check . --fix && uv run ruff format .
    ```

    Or use the Makefile shortcut:

    ```shell
    make fix
    ```

**Connecting to a Different API Backend:**

> Internal Griptape Developers with access to API project

To point your local engine at a different API instance (e.g., a local Griptape Nodes IDE server), set the `GRIPTAPE_NODES_API_BASE_URL` environment variable:

```shell
GRIPTAPE_NODES_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001 gtn
```

**Connecting to a Different UI:**

> Internal Griptape Developers with access to UI project

To point your local engine at a different UI instance (e.g., a local Griptape Nodes UI), set the `GRIPTAPE_NODES_UI_BASE_URL` environment variable:

```shell
GRIPTAPE_NODES_UI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 gtn
```

## Configuration for Development

Griptape Nodes uses a configuration loading system. For full details, see the [Configuration Documentation](docs/configuration.md). Here's what's crucial for development:

1. **`.env` File:** The engine still needs your `GT_CLOUD_API_KEY` to communicate with the Workflow Editor. Ensure this is set in the system-wide environment file located via `gtn init` (typically `~/.config/griptape_nodes/.env`). Running `gtn init` will guide you through creating this if needed.

1. **Using the Local Nodes Library:** By default, a regularly installed engine looks for node definitions (the library config file: `griptape_nodes_library.json` or `griptape-nodes-library.json`) in a system data directory. For development, you **must** tell the engine (run via `gtn` from your cloned repository's root) to use the library file directly from your cloned repository (`./libraries/griptape_nodes_library/griptape_nodes_library.json`).

    - **How to Override:** Create a configuration file in a location that has higher priority than the default system paths. The simplest location is the **root of your cloned `griptape-nodes-engine` repository**.

    - Create a file named `griptape_nodes_config.json` in the project root.

    - Add the following content:

        ```json
        {
          "app_events": {
            "on_app_initialization_complete": {
              "libraries_to_register": [
                "libraries/griptape_nodes_library/griptape_nodes_library.json",
                "libraries/griptape_nodes_advanced_media_library/griptape_nodes_library.json",
                "libraries/griptape_cloud/griptape_nodes_library.json",
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```

    - **Why this works:** When you run `gtn` from the project root, the engine's configuration loader finds this `griptape_nodes_config.json` first (due to the "Current Directory & Parents" search path) and uses its `libraries_to_register` setting, overriding the default path.

## Environment Variables

Griptape Nodes uses a variety of environment variables for influencing its low-level behavior.

- **`GRIPTAPE_NODES_API_BASE_URL`**: The base URL for the Griptape Nodes API (default `https://api.nodes.griptape.ai`). This is used to connect the engine to the Workflow Editor.
- **`GT_CLOUD_API_KEY`**: The API key for authenticating with the Griptape Cloud API. This is required for the engine to function properly.
- **`STATIC_SERVER_HOST`**: The host for the static file server (default `localhost`). The app's server binds here, and the engine assumes it when no server URL is reported.
- **`STATIC_SERVER_PORT`**: The port for the static file server (default `8124`). The app's server binds here, and the engine assumes it when no server URL is reported.
- **`STATIC_SERVER_URL`**: The URL path the workspace is served under (default `/workspace`).
- **`STATIC_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL`**: The log level for the app's static file server (default `error`).

## Contributing to Documentation

The documentation website ([docs.griptapenodes.com](https://docs.griptapenodes.com)) is built using MkDocs with the Material theme.

1. **Setup:** Ensure you've installed dependencies using `make install`.

1. **Source Files:** Documentation source files are located in the `/docs` directory in Markdown format. The site structure is defined in `mkdocs.yml` in the project root.

1. **Serving Locally:** To preview your changes live, first ensure that you have run:

    ```shell
    make install
    ```

    Then run the MkDocs development server:

    ```shell
    uv run mkdocs serve
    ```

    Or use the Makefile shortcut:

    ```shell
    make docs/serve
    ```

This will start a local webserver (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`). The site will automatically reload when you save changes to the documentation files or `mkdocs.yml`.

1. **Making Changes:** Edit the Markdown files in the `/docs` directory. Add new pages by creating new `.md` files and updating the `nav` section in `mkdocs.yml`.

## Code Style and Quality

- We use **Ruff** for linting and formatting. Please ensure your code conforms to the style by running `make format` or `make fix`.
- We use **Pyright** for static type checking. Run `make check` to ensure there are no type errors.
- Run tests using `make test/unit` or `uv run pytest`.

## Gating Work Behind a Beta Feature

If you're building something user-visible or behavior-changing that isn't ready to be on for everyone, you can put it behind a beta feature. Users turn beta features on and off from the Beta page in the editor's Settings. Every feature you register in the engine appears there automatically, with no editor change needed.

This section covers engine features. Node libraries, including the standard library, declare their own in the `beta_features` list of their library JSON and check them from nodes with `self.is_beta_feature_enabled("<id>")`. See [Beta Features in Authoring Libraries](docs/development/custom_nodes/authoring_libraries.md#beta-features).

1. **Register the feature** in `src/griptape_nodes/retained_mode/beta_features.py`. All engine features live in that one module. The `name` and `description` are shown to users on the Beta page, so describe what changes and where, in plain terms:

    ```python
    PARALLEL_BRANCH_RESOLUTION = register_beta_feature(
        BetaFeature(
            id="parallel_branch_resolution",
            name="Parallel branch resolution",
            description="Runs independent branches of a flow at the same time instead of one after another.",
            owner="@your-github-handle",
            remove_by=date(2027, 1, 31),
        )
    )
    ```

1. **Check it** at the point where the old and new behavior split:

    ```python
    if is_beta_enabled(PARALLEL_BRANCH_RESOLUTION, self.engine.config_manager):
        ...
    ```

    `is_beta_enabled` also applies the global switch users turn all beta features off with, `beta_features.enabled`. When it is `false`, every feature is off. Always check a feature through `is_beta_enabled`, never by reading its config value directly.

1. **Turn it on locally** by adding it to the `beta_features` section of your `griptape_nodes_config.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "beta_features": {
        "parallel_branch_resolution": true
      }
    }
    ```

    You can also set it for a single run with an environment variable:

    ```shell
    GTN_CONFIG_BETA_FEATURES__PARALLEL_BRANCH_RESOLUTION=true make run
    ```

**Rules:**

- A beta feature must never change saved data or the protocol. Workflows have to open the same way whether the feature is on or off.
- Every feature needs a `remove_by` date, at most 180 days out. By that date, make the feature standard or delete it.
- Ids are lowercase snake_case and must be unique across the engine and the editor, so check the editor's features before picking one. `enabled` is reserved for the global switch.

**When `tests/unit/retained_mode/test_beta_features.py` fails:** once a feature passes its `remove_by` date, this test fails on every PR, including ones that don't touch the feature. The failure names the feature and its owner. To fix it, make the feature standard, delete it, or extend `remove_by` (still at most 180 days out) and explain why in the PR.

**Removing a feature:** delete its registration and every `is_beta_enabled` check. If the feature is becoming standard, keep the new code path. Users' leftover `beta_features` entries do nothing and don't need cleaning up.

## Submitting Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`.
1. Make your changes, commit them with clear messages, and ensure all checks (`make check`) and tests (`make test/unit`) pass.
1. If the change is user-facing, add an entry file to `changelog.d/`. See [Changelog](#changelog).
1. Push your branch to your fork: `git push origin my-feature-branch`.
1. Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch of the `griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine` repository.
1. Clearly describe your changes in the PR description.

## Changelog

[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) follows [Keep a Changelog 2.0.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/2.0.0/). Each version's section is its GitHub release notes.

A PR with a user-facing change does not edit `CHANGELOG.md`. It adds one file to [`changelog.d/`](changelog.d/README.md), named `<type>-<slug>.md` for one of `added`, `changed`, `deprecated`, `removed`, `fixed`, or `security`. The whole file is the bullet, with no heading above it. All of `changelog.d/fixed-license-not-permitted-dropdowns.md`:

```markdown
- Model dropdowns no longer mark every model "Not permitted by your license" when two installed
  libraries provide a node with the same name.
  [#5618](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes-engine/issues/5618)
```

One entry per file is what keeps PRs from conflicting: two PRs adding entries touch different files, so neither has to rebase on the other. `make changelog` prints the `[Unreleased]` section as the next release will show it, with every entry file folded in.

Write for the person upgrading, not the reviewer: what they will notice, where, and why. Link the GitHub issue on the entry's last line when there is one. Start breaking changes with `**Breaking:**` and link the upgrade steps in `MIGRATION.md`. Refactors, tests, CI, and docs-only changes get no entry. The full style guide is in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#changelog).

`make check/changelog`, part of `make check` and CI, validates the structure of `CHANGELOG.md` and of every entry file, and fails on an entry written under `## [Unreleased]` instead of into a file of its own. It never requires a PR to add an entry. That call stays with people.

## Making a Release (Maintainers)

Griptape Nodes uses [**trunk-based development**](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/), where the `main` branch is the primary development branch. There are two types of releases:

- **Regular releases**: Cut from `main` for new features and regular development cycles
- **Patch releases**: Cut from release branches for bug fixes to specific versions

When you publish a regular release, a release branch (e.g., `release/v0.65`) is automatically created. Patch releases are made from these branches.

### Regular Releases (from main)

Use this process for minor and major version bumps that include new features or regular development work:

1. Check out the `main` branch locally:

    ```shell
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```

1. Check the version:

    There should be an existing `chore: bump v0.66.0` commit elevating the minor version on `main` 1 higher than what is currently `stable`. If not, run `make version/minor` and merge that PR first so the version on `main` is greater than the current `stable` version.

1. Read the release notes you are about to publish:

    ```shell
    make changelog
    ```

    This prints the `[Unreleased]` section with every `changelog.d/` entry folded in, which is exactly what the release notes will say. Fix wording now, in the entry files, because after the next step they are gone.

1. Publish the release:

    ```shell
    make version/publish
    ```

    This stops before doing anything if `CHANGELOG.md` or `changelog.d/` holds uncommitted changes, since the roll would overwrite them. Otherwise it folds the `changelog.d/` entry files into `CHANGELOG.md` under the release heading (e.g., `## [0.66.0] - 2026-09-22`), deletes them, and commits both as `chore: release v0.66.0` on a detached HEAD, so your local `main` still matches `origin/main`. It then creates and pushes:

    - A version tag (e.g., `v0.66.0`) on that commit
    - An updated `stable` tag
    - A release branch (e.g., `release/v0.66`) for future patch releases

    The fold is part of the release, not a step you can forget: `make version/assert-rolled` runs between the commit and the tag, and fails the release if any entry file survived it. An entry file left behind would be published a second time by the next release. If it does fail, nothing has been tagged or pushed yet; run `git checkout -` to get back to your branch, fix what it reports, and start the step over.

    It refuses to release with nothing to say. If nothing notable shipped, run `make version/publish allow_empty=1`.

1. Update the version on `main`

    The `Bump Main to Next Version` workflow opens a PR that advances `main` to the next minor version and applies the same changelog roll. Merge it. Other PRs cannot merge until it lands.

    If the workflow did not run, do both by hand and PR the result. Use the date from the tag's changelog heading, and name `changelog.d` so the deletions of the entries it folded travel with it. `--allow-empty` is there because the release you just cut already took everything that was unreleased:

    ```shell
    # After releasing v0.66.0
    uv run python scripts/changelog.py roll 0.66.0 --date YYYY-MM-DD --allow-empty
    git commit -m "chore: roll changelog for v0.66.0" -- CHANGELOG.md changelog.d
    make version/assert-rolled
    make version/minor
    ```

    If `make version/assert-rolled` fails here, amend the commit to include the roll. You are on your own branch, not a detached HEAD, so there is nothing to abandon.

### Patch Releases (from release branches)

Use this process to release bug fixes for a specific version without including newer features from `main`:

1. **Identify the base version** - Find the last stable tag to patch:

    ```shell
    # List recent version tags
    git tag -l 'v*' --sort=-version:refname | head -5
    ```

1. **Create or checkout the release branch** - Release branches follow the pattern `release/v{major.minor}`:

    If the release branch doesn't exist yet, create it from the tag:

    ```shell
    # Example: Creating release/v0.65 from tag v0.65.2
    git checkout -b release/v0.65 v0.65.2
    git push -u origin release/v0.65
    ```

    If the release branch already exists, check it out:

    ```shell
    git checkout release/v0.65
    git pull origin release/v0.65
    ```

1. **Cherry-pick commits from main** - Identify the bug fix commits to backport:

    ```shell
    # View recent commits on main to find the ones you need
    git log main --oneline

    # Cherry-pick specific commits (replace with actual commit hashes)
    git cherry-pick abc123
    git cherry-pick def456
    ```

    If you encounter conflicts, resolve them and continue. The fix's changelog entry is its own file in `changelog.d/`, so it cherry-picks without conflicting.

    ```shell
    # After resolving conflicts in your editor
    git add .
    git cherry-pick --continue
    ```

1. **Bump the patch version**:

    ```shell
    make version/patch
    ```

    This bumps the version (e.g., `0.65.2` → `0.65.3`) and automatically commits the change.

1. **Publish the patch release**:

    ```shell
    make version/publish
    ```

    This folds the release branch's `changelog.d/` entries into `## [0.65.3]`, then creates and pushes the version tag (e.g., `v0.65.3`) and updates the `stable` tag.

1. **No synchronization back to `main`** - A patch release does not touch `main`, and does not need to: `main` already carries the next minor version. The fix's entry file stays in `changelog.d/` on `main`, so the next minor release lists it too. The `Bump Main to Next Version` workflow skips any released tag that does not end in `.0`.

### Important Notes

- **Patch releases** should only contain bug fixes and critical updates, not new features
- **Feature changes** should go through regular releases from `main`
- Release branches follow the pattern `release/v{major.minor}` (e.g., `release/v0.65`)
- Version tags follow the format `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}` (e.g., `v0.65.3`)
- The `stable` tag always points to the latest stable release across all versions
- The `version-bump-next-on-release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow opens a PR advancing `main` to the next minor version and rolling its changelog, and only for minor and major releases
- The `stable-release.yml` workflow uses that version's `CHANGELOG.md` section as the GitHub release notes
