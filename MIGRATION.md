# Unreleased

## `worker.heartbeat_startup_grace_s` is now `worker.library_load_timeout_s`

Rename the key in any config file or environment that sets it; the environment variable is
`GTN_CONFIG_WORKER__LIBRARY_LOAD_TIMEOUT_S`. The old name is not read, so a setting left behind
silently reverts to the 600 second default.

What the value bounds is unchanged: how long a worker may take to load its library, covering a node
waiting for its library's worker and a project switch waiting for each worker to adopt it. It no
longer delays heartbeat enforcement, which is what the old name suggested. `worker.heartbeat_timeout_s` and `worker.heartbeat_interval_s` own that.

## Libraries no longer choose a worker

Where a library's nodes execute now follows from its dependencies. A library that declared
`SuggestedWorkerMode(WORKER)`, or that a user set to "Isolated" through `worker_mode_override`, used
to be hosted whole in a worker process. It now loads into the engine process like any other
library, and its `pip_dependencies` install into `<library>/.venv`, which sits on the engine's own
import path. Packages that conflict with the engine's now conflict in that process.

**Library authors.** Move the packages that need isolation into `pip_dependencies_exec`, under
`metadata.dependencies` in `griptape-nodes-library.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "pip_dependencies": ["pillow"],
  "pip_dependencies_exec": ["torch", "diffusers"]
}
```

The library's nodes still load in the engine, so the editor gets their real traits, converters,
and validators. Only `process`/`aprocess` runs in a worker, against `<library>/.venv-exec`, which is
resolved over both sets. A node module must stay importable without the execution set, so import
those packages inside `process`. See
[How to declare execution dependencies](docs/development/custom_nodes/node_isolation_with_workers.md#how-to-declare-execution-dependencies).

`WorkerModeCompatibility`, `SuggestedWorkerMode`, and the `worker_mode_override` key in
`libraries_to_register` still parse, so neither old manifests nor old config files fail to load.
They have no effect. While a library still asks for a worker and declares no
`pip_dependencies_exec`, loading it logs one INFO line saying so.

**Also removed:**

- The `WORKER_DELEGATED` and `WORKER_PENDING` library lifecycle states.
- `requires_worker` on a library's diagnostics.
- `node_schemas` on `ReportLibraryLoadedRequest`, with the `WorkerNodeSchema` and
    `WorkerParameterSchema` payloads it carried.
- The strict-mode rules `reentrant-bus-in-init`, `parameter-behaviors-dropped-in-schema`,
    `connection-hooks-inert-on-worker`, and `value-hooks-execute-only-on-worker`, and the
    `LOAD_PROBE` scope kind. `parameter-mutation-during-aprocess` is the only rule left.
- The fitness problems reporting that request handlers and post-dispatch hooks are unsupported in an
    isolated library. Both now work in every library.

## Parameter values carry their type

**Request API and editor clients.** A parameter value of a type JSON lacks arrives as a dict whose
`$type` names its Python type. A tuple that arrived as `[1, 2]` now arrives as:

```json
{"$type": "builtins:tuple", "$value": [1, 2]}
```

Send a value back in the same form to set that exact type.

[Parameter values](docs/guides/mcp/external_clients.md#parameter-values) lists the forms and which
fields carry them.

**Library authors.** A field of your own request, result, or event payload that holds parameter
values must be annotated `Value`. A field typed `Any` that holds a griptape object, or any value
JSON can't represent, now fails to send:

```python
from griptape_nodes.serialization.values import Value


@dataclass
class ColorizeResultSuccess(ResultPayloadSuccess):
    image: Value  # was: Any
```

To make a class you own save, decorate it with `register_value_codec` and
give it `to_state()` and a `from_state()` classmethod. For a class you cannot edit, pass the
conversion functions from your library's `before_library_nodes_loaded`:

```python
import numpy as np

from griptape_nodes.exe_types.core_types import register_value_codec
from griptape_nodes.node_library.advanced_node_library import AdvancedNodeLibrary


@register_value_codec
class Palette:
    def __init__(self, colors: list[str]) -> None:
        self.colors = colors

    def to_state(self) -> dict:
        return {"colors": self.colors}

    @classmethod
    def from_state(cls, state: dict) -> "Palette":
        return cls(state["colors"])


class MyLibrary(AdvancedNodeLibrary):
    def before_library_nodes_loaded(self, library_data, library) -> None:
        register_value_codec(
            np.ndarray,
            to_state=lambda array: {"dtype": str(array.dtype), "shape": list(array.shape), "data": array.tobytes()},
            from_state=lambda state: np.frombuffer(state["data"], state["dtype"]).reshape(state["shape"]),
        )
```

## `serializable=False` outputs are held in their own process across a worker boundary

`Parameter(serializable=False)` has always kept a value out of saved workflow files. On an **output** it
now also means "hold this object in the process that produced it": when the value would cross a worker
process boundary, the engine keeps the object where it is and sends an opaque key in its place, and the
consuming node's read turns the key back into the object. This is how a library isolated in a worker hands
a pipeline or a latent tensor to its next node. See
[Passing Values That Cannot Be Serialized](docs/development/custom_nodes/passing_unserializable_values.md).

Nothing changes for a graph that stays in one process, for values that are already data, or for values on
a parameter that declares nothing: a string, a number or a dict of them on a declared parameter still
travels as itself, because a key would be unresolvable on the far side.

The cache belongs to the **worker**, not to a library. One worker can host several libraries, and they
share it: a co-hosted library handed a key can resolve it, because they genuinely share a process. Keys a
library chooses through `local_objects.put` are namespaced by that library inside the worker, so
co-tenants cannot collide. What an object cannot do is leave the process that built it.

A list or dictionary parameter is unaffected: declaring `serializable=False` on one still keeps it out of
saved workflows. It adds no holding, because a container builds its value from its children. Put the value
on an ordinary parameter marked `serializable=False` if you want it cached.

## Traits can save runtime state

A trait keeps its existing constructor. To persist runtime changes, implement `to_state()` and
`apply_state()`:

```python
class Threshold(Trait):
    def __init__(self, level: int = 5) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.level = level

    def to_state(self) -> dict[str, int]:
        return {"level": self.level}

    def apply_state(self, state: dict[str, int]) -> None:
        if "level" in state:
            self.level = state["level"]
```

The default methods save nothing, so existing traits remain compatible. State must contain plain
JSON-compatible values. The engine applies it to the trait the node already built, preserving
callbacks and other constructor wiring. For a parameter the node declares, only keys that differ
from what the node builds are saved, so changing a constructor default still reaches existing
workflows.

When the node does not build a saved trait, the engine builds it with `from_state()`, which passes
the state to the constructor. Override it when `to_state()` keys are not constructor arguments.
The state can hold only some keys, so fall back to defaults for missing ones.

## Branched workflows show a title instead of a file path

Branching a workflow used to set the new workflow's `metadata.name` — the human-readable display
name — to its registry key, which is derived from the file path. A branch of "Shot 010 Comp" saved
under `shots/sh010/` came back named `shots/sh010/comp_branch_1`, so anywhere the editor shows a
workflow title, a branch read as a path while its own source next to it read as a title.

A branch is now named after the workflow it came from:

|                 | before                      | after                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| registry key    | `shots/sh010/comp_branch_1` | `shots/sh010/comp_branch_1` (unchanged) |
| `metadata.name` | `shots/sh010/comp_branch_1` | `Shot 010 Comp (branch 1)`              |

Registry keys are unchanged, so anything that looks workflows up by name keeps working. Merging a
branch no longer overwrites its source's title, and resetting a branch no longer overwrites its own.

`BranchWorkflowRequest` takes an optional `branched_workflow_display_name` if you want to set the
label yourself:

```python
BranchWorkflowRequest(workflow_name="shots/sh010/comp", branched_workflow_display_name="Lighting Test")
```

**Workflows already on disk.** Files written by earlier versions still carry the path in their
header. The engine shows the readable name (just the file name, e.g. `comp_branch_1`) when it loads
one, and the header is rewritten the next time that workflow is saved. Nothing is rewritten during
load, so no files change until you save them. Only a display name that exactly equals its own
registry key is repaired — a title you deliberately wrote with a `/` in it is left alone.

## Agent streaming payloads carry `thread_id`

`AgentStreamEvent`, `AgentThinkingEvent`, `AgentToolCallEvent`, and `AgentToolResultEvent`
now require a `thread_id` naming the conversation they belong to. Execution events are
broadcast to every connected client, so a client with more than one chat surface open
previously had to assume a delta belonged to whichever turn it started last. The id
matches the `thread_id` on the `RunAgentResultSuccess` that ends the turn.

If your code constructs one of these payloads, add the thread id:

```python
AgentStreamEvent(thread_id=thread_id, token=token)
```

Consumers keep working unchanged; `thread_id` is a new field on the wire, not a rename.

## Test isolation for node library test suites

`GriptapeNodes` is no longer built by `SingletonMeta`. Its managers now live on an `Engine`
that is resolved per context, so clearing the metaclass cache no longer resets engine state.

If your library's test suite copied this repo's old isolation pattern:

```python
from griptape_nodes.utils.metaclasses import SingletonMeta

SingletonMeta._instances.clear()
```

replace it with:

```python
from griptape_nodes.retained_mode.engine import reset_root_engine

reset_root_engine()
```

This matters even though the old call still imports and runs: it silently stops resetting the
engine, so a patched `USER_CONFIG_PATH` or `ENV_VAR_PATH` set up per test no longer takes
effect after the first test touches the engine. Tests keep passing while reading config from a
previous test's temporary directory.

A test that needs an engine it can hold, rather than a reset between cases, can use
`engine_scope()` from the same module.

## `package_to_folder` reports where it put the workflow

`WorkflowPackager.package_to_folder` returned a `list[str]` of library paths. It now returns a
`PackagedBundle`:

```python
packaged = packager.package_to_folder(destination, workflow)
packaged.entrypoint_workflow_path  # Path, relative to the bundle root
packaged.library_paths  # tuple[Path, ...], relative to the bundle root
```

## Migration Steps

### For Image Processing Nodes

Replace deprecated nodes with these specific nodes from the main Griptape Nodes Library:

![Grayscale Image node](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3799cb9-bb79-485a-8446-aca639b66aa7) ![Gaussian Blur Image node](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a602390-bfd5-4452-873f-0f8e94cc292e) ![Rescale Image node](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/925cb3e5-cda5-44b0-9132-99e74e98dda2)

1. **Desaturate** → Replace with **`Grayscale Image`**

    - Location: `Image/Edit/Grayscale Image`
    - Same functionality: converts color images to grayscale
    - Additional features: The new node provides more control over output format, allowing you to choose PNG, JPEG, or WEBP, and adjust quality levels

1. **Gaussian Blur** → Replace with **`Gaussian Blur Image`**

    - Location: `Image/Effects/Gaussian Blur Image`
    - Same functionality: applies gaussian blur with configurable radius
    - Additional features: The new node provides more control over output format, allowing you to choose PNG, JPEG, or WEBP, and adjust quality levels

1. **Rescale Image** → Replace with **`Rescale Image`**

    - Location: `Image/Edit/Rescale Image`
    - **Important:** The new Rescale Image node has changed significantly from the deprecated version
    - The old node used an `nx` scaling basis (scale by 2, 3, 4, etc.)
    - The new node offers multiple resize modes:
        - **percentage** - scales via a percentage basis. If the old node was set to 2, set the new one to 200%
        - **width** - allows you to set the target size for the width of the image. It will maintain aspect ratio for the height
        - **height** - allows you to set the target size for the height of the image. It will maintain aspect ratio for the width
        - **width and height** - allows you to specify both width and height, with options for how to fit the image:
            - **fit** - fits the image within the width and height, maintaining aspect ratio
            - **fill** - crops the image to fill the width and height
            - **stretch** - stretches the image to fit the width and height
    - Additional features: More control over output format (PNG, JPEG, or WEBP) and quality levels

    **Example resize modes:**

    ![Fit mode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3f6c9c7-f4ef-41bb-a9c8-4a52e0229511) ![Fill mode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39249682-59c8-4ba6-a4dc-ac4dc7804a7a) ![Stretch mode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab3a14a2-ef5f-44a8-bddf-ec53ae01be3e)

The Grayscale Image and Gaussian Blur Image replacement nodes have equivalent functionality to their deprecated counterparts, with additional output format controls.

### For Diffusion Pipeline Nodes

1. Identify all deprecated diffusion pipeline nodes in your flows
1. Replace each with a combination of:
    - **Diffusion Pipeline Builder** node (configure your model and settings)
    - **Generate Image (Diffusion Pipeline)** node (run the generation)
1. Refer to the [Diffusion Pipeline documentation](https://docs.griptapenodes.com/en/stable/nodes/advanced_media_library/diffusion_pipelines/) for detailed examples
1. The new system offers more flexibility with:
    - Composable pipeline components
    - Reusable pipeline configurations
    - Better control over model loading and optimization

### For LoRA Nodes

1. Replace **Flux LoRA File** with the new `Load LoRA` node
1. The new node is available under `LoRAs/Load LoRA` in the Advanced Media Library
1. Connect the output to your Diffusion Pipeline Builder

### For Audio Nodes

1. Replace **Eleven Music Generation** with **`Eleven Labs Music Generation`**
    - Location: `Audio/Eleven Labs Music Generation` in the main Griptape Nodes Library
    - Same functionality: generates music using the Eleven Labs Music Generation API
    - The replacement node has identical functionality and uses the same underlying API
    - Simply swap the deprecated node for the new one - all parameters work the same way
