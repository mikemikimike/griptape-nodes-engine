"""Tests for worker-side RemoteHandler dispatch and register_remote_handlers.

These tests pin down the two invariants that replaced the old
``ForwardFromWorkerMixin`` machinery:

1. ``RemoteHandler`` forwards to the orchestrator only while the worker is
   inside a ``node_execution_scope``. Outside that scope it delegates
   to the ``original`` handler it displaced, which preserves bootstrap and
   library-load behaviour (e.g. nodes calling ``self.add_parameter(...)``
   from ``__init__``).
2. ``register_remote_handlers`` swaps the dispatch table entry for every
   registered type outside ``LOCAL_ONLY_REQUEST_TYPES``, preserving the "one handler per
   request type" invariant enforced by ``assign_manager_to_request_type``.
   Missing an original handler raises with a bootstrap-order diagnostic.
