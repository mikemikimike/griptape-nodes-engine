"""Filesystem requests must not cross the worker boundary.

Forwarding-by-default made "every request a node can issue survives a cattrs round trip" a
requirement, and the filesystem family does not meet it in two ways:

- `content` is `str | bytes`. The wire form base64s bytes into a JSON string and cattrs resolves
  the union back to `str`, so a worker's write landed on disk as mojibake with no error raised
  anywhere. Silent data corruption.
- A path carrying macro variables is a `MacroPath` wrapping a `ParsedMacro`, which will not
  serialize at all. The worker blocked until the forward timed out.

None of that is a reason to make the wire smarter: the workspace is shared on disk, so a worker's
own answer was already the correct one. These tests pin the routing decision and the mechanism
behind it, so neither can be undone by accident.
