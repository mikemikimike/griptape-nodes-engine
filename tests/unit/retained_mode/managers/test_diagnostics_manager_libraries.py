"""Tests for what a report says about a library's worker, and why it cannot run.

A library whose nodes execute in a separate process has two ways of being broken that send the
reader in opposite directions: the worker never started, or the worker started and the library
inside it did not. `worker_ready` is the field that tells those apart.

The wrong answer is specifically a false yes. Readiness is a gate the worker manager installs
when a spawn is requested, and it reports an absent gate as settled -- deliberate there, since
code waiting on a library that will never spawn should not wait forever. Read as "settled means
up", every library whose worker was never asked for has one running. Workers start with a
session, and a bundle collected from the CLI comes before any session begins, so that would be
every worker library in the report.
