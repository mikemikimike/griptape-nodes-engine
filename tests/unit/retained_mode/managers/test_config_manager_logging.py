"""Tests for how a config load reaches the shared logger and its diagnostic sinks.

Any config file can supply one of the related logging settings, so the sinks are applied at the
end of every load rather than by whichever caller wrote one; a load that skipped it left the
engine logging somewhere other than where `report.json` said.

Re-applying is not free, though. Every config write reloads and each apply re-scans the log
directory for files to age out, so an unrelated write must be a no-op.
