"""Metadata reports whether each library is actually in the registry.

Metadata is derived from whatever `libraries_to_register` currently resolves to, while the
registry holds what was actually loaded. Those two disagree whenever config changes after
boot without a library reload: a settings write updates config and only marks a refresh as
pending, so until the user acts on it the engine advertises libraries it cannot answer any
other question about.

Nothing in the response used to expose that. A client would follow a metadata entry with a
name-keyed call and get `no Library with that name was registered` back, which is what
produced a wall of errors in a reported session. `is_registered` makes the difference
visible so those entries can be shown as pending a refresh instead of being queried.
