"""Regression tests for the "refresh libraries produces more errors" race.

Reloading libraries is not atomic. `_run_reload_libraries` empties the registry
(ClearAllObjectState, then an unload loop) and only afterwards calls
`load_all_libraries_from_config`, which re-registers libraries one at a time. In the
reported session that window was ~29s wide: the reload began at 14:27:16 and finished at
14:27:45, and the editor's update sweep landed inside it at 14:27:26-31, producing one
hard failure per library that had not yet been re-registered:

    ERROR  Attempted to get all library info for a Library named 'Sendgrid Library'.
           Failed because no Library with that name was registered.
    ERROR  Attempted to check for updates for Library 'Topaz Labs'.
           Failed because no Library with that name was registered.

Every one of those libraries registered successfully seconds later, so the failures were
purely an artifact of being asked mid-reload.

These tests pin two properties. Every GUI-facing query awaits
`_libraries_loading_complete` rather than answering from a half-empty registry. And the
gate closes before the unload loop, so it covers the window where the registry is empty --
but no earlier than the enumeration that precedes it, which waits on the same gate and
would otherwise deadlock the reload against itself.
