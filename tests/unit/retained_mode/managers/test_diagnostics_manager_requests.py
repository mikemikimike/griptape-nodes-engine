"""The three diagnostics requests, dispatched through a real engine.

Every other test in this area builds one section, or hands the manager a stand-in engine. These
go through `engine.ahandle_request` the way the editor and the CLI do, because some of what a
user depends on only exists once the pieces are assembled: that the file written is a zip that
opens, that the manifest describes the archive it is inside, that a secret the engine logged a
second ago is not in it, and that an unwritable destination comes back as a failure result.

Nothing here touches the network. `CloudConnectionCheck` is the only check that would, and the
tests that run the checks replace the call that opens the socket.
