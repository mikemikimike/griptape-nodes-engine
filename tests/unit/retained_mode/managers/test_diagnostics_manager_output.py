"""Tests for where a diagnostics bundle goes and what the engine says it was called.

These are the parts a user checks the moment collection finishes: the path printed in the
terminal and the name in the success message. Both were wrong in ways invisible until someone
goes looking for the file — a relative `--output` tested against one directory and written to
another, and a name reported as requested when static files had saved it under a different one.

`_cloud_api_key` is here for the same reason: reading a secret resolves the workspace, and a
missing workspace is exactly what these checks are collected to report.
