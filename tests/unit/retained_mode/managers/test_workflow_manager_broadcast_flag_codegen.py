"""A transport flag set for the sake of a loop must not end up in a saved workflow file.

``NodeExecutor._silence_packaged_node_creation_broadcasts`` clears ``broadcast_result`` on a
packaged loop body's create commands so rebuilding the body stays invisible to editors. Workflow
codegen, though, writes out every create-command field whose value differs from its default
(``WorkflowCodeGenerator._generate_node_creation_code``) -- so the same mutation applied anywhere upstream
of a save writes ``broadcast_result=False`` into the artist's ``.py`` file, and on the publish path
into a library. That is why the silencing lives at the local deserialization boundaries, which never
save, rather than at packaging time, which several branches do save from.

These tests pin both halves: that codegen really is that literal about non-default fields (so the
constraint is real and not folklore), and that a silenced package result would carry the flag
through if it were ever handed to the writer.
