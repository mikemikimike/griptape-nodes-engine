"""Root-cause tests: dropping the project config layer exposes a contaminated user layer.

This is the mechanism behind the stale-library report. Three facts combine:

1. `libraries_to_register` lives at
   `app_events.on_app_initialization_complete.libraries_to_register` -- a *nested*,
   *list-valued* key. `_load_config_from_env_vars` can reach a nested key via a `__`
   path separator (e.g. `GTN_CONFIG_WORKER__HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_S`), but a list-valued
   setting has no string representation the `Settings` model accepts, so any value
   supplied for `libraries_to_register` is rejected and dropped. No `GTN_CONFIG_*`
   variable can set or shadow it.

2. `merge_dicts` is called with the default `merge_lists=False`, so a project layer that
   declares `libraries_to_register` *replaces* the user layer's list, hiding a polluted
   user layer for as long as the project layer is loaded.

3. `_activate_project` calls `clear_project_layers()` and then, for a project with no
   project-adjacent config to layer on, falls through to a bare `load_configs()`. With
   `_project_config_path` now None there is no project layer to do the replacing, so the
   user layer's list becomes the effective config. Activation refuses an id with no loaded
   template outright, but **system defaults still takes this path**, so the exposure is
   narrowed rather than removed.

Editing library settings in the editor is what puts those entries in the user layer. The
editor renders the MERGED config and every write to a list-valued key sends the whole
rendered array, so `set_config_value` builds a delta holding the merged list, which
`_write_user_config_delta` then merges with `merge_lists=False` -- replacing the array in
the user config file. Toggling a library's enabled switch, changing its execution mode, or
removing a row therefore copies the active project's entire library list into the user
config, where it persists after the project is gone.
