"""End-to-end coverage for deleting a node while a run is in flight.

Deleting a node mid-run can fail in two very different shapes, and only one of them is loud:

1. **The run wedges.** The scheduler still believes the deleted node owes it something, so
   in-degrees never reach zero, no leaves are left to pick up, and the driver idles forever. The
   editor's Run button never clears.
2. **The run survives, but stops being observable — or worse, silently changes answer.** Deleting a
   node tears down its connections through the ordinary connection-deletion path, which resets a
   target's input to the parameter default. If the target is *currently executing*, it computes off
   the default and the run reports success with the wrong output.

The policy these tests encode: cancelling the whole run is only acceptable when the deleted node
still owed the run **unresolved** work. Deleting something the run has already finished with — a
resolved upstream node, a node nothing live depends on, an unconnected bystander — must leave the
run alone.

Streaming is how shape 2 becomes visible. Text appearing on a node in the editor is a series of
``ProgressEvent``s, so a node that keeps computing but stops announcing chunks looks exactly like a
dead run. The fixture streams while it is parked so a test can watch that.
