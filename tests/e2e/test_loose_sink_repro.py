"""End-to-end coverage for how the DAG scheduler seeds graphs around data-only nodes.

Two shapes are exercised:

- A straight control chain with a *loose* data sink hanging off the middle node. The sink
  has no control connections, so it is seeded into its own graph, and that graph's upstream
  data recursion can adopt a control node that has not run yet. The adopted node still holds
  the control token, so it must advance control even though its graph has work left in it.
- A node with two control outputs where *both* wire into one downstream control input.
  Only one output is taken at runtime, so the downstream node must still run exactly once.
- A loose sink reading a loop's collected results, which adopts the loop's end node before
  the loop hands that same end node the control token on its way out.
