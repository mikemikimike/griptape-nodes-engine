"""A running group must stay in the editor's involved nodes for the whole run (issue #5486).

The invariant under test: an isolated flow is a packaged copy of a loop body, so it describes no
run the canvas is watching and must broadcast neither of the two whole-flow lifecycle events. Both
are unqualified -- `InvolvedNodesEvent` replaces the editor's single involved-node set wholesale,
`ControlFlowResolvedEvent` reads as "the run is over" -- and neither carries a flow name, so
either one sent per iteration is attributed to the run the artist started.

Asserted over both execution modes by draining the same queue the websocket serializes from: every
involvement announcement names the group and the group's real child, none ever names a packaged
copy, and no flow announces itself as finished while the group is still running.
