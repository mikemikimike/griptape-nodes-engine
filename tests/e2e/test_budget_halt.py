"""End-to-end coverage for a run that Griptape Cloud refuses over budget.

The unit tests prove each piece: the body parses, the sentence reads well, the halt is found under
whatever wrapped it. None of them proves the pieces are wired to each other. This suite runs a real
flow against a real HTTP server answering a real 403, and asks the three questions an artist would:

1. **Did the run stop?** A refusal the engine notices but does not act on is the worst outcome --
   the run carries on spending against a wall it has already hit.
2. **Does the message say which budget?** The epic's words are "never a generic error". The failure
   the editor receives has to name every budget that refused, not the node that noticed.
3. **Does a wired Failed branch still run?** A refusal is one node's failure. The Failed branch may
   lead somewhere the budget does not reach, such as a local model, so it is taken like any other.

Both execution modes run every test, since each frames a node failure on its own way out and the
halt's wording has to survive both.
