"""Fixture nodes for the budget-halt e2e tests.

Three node types, for the three ways a refusal reaches the engine.

``CloudCallNode`` is a ``SuccessFailureNode`` that makes one HTTP call to a URL the test supplies
and hands whatever it raises to the same two functions a real credit-spending node uses:
``refusal_from_exception`` to decide whether Griptape Cloud refused it over budget, and
``_handle_failure_exception`` to route the result. Pointed at a stub that answers 403 with a
recorded refusal body, it exercises the whole path -- ``httpx`` raising, the chain being walked,
the body being parsed, the halt being worded, and the result routed down Failed -- with no
network and no Cloud account.

Two instances of the one node type make the Failed-branch test: the first is refused, the second
hangs off its Failed output and writes a file when it runs. That file is how the test sees the
branch was taken.

``UnhandledCloudCallNode`` and ``DriverHaltNode`` cover the nodes that do *not* do that work
themselves, which is most of them. The first lets the raw HTTP error out, the way any node
spending through a Cloud driver does; the second raises a halt that names no node, the way a
driver several frames below the node does when it recognizes the refusal itself. Both rely on
``NodeManager`` recognizing and wording the halt at the one point every node failure crosses --
without which the first reads as a bare 403 and the second never says where to look.

Kept to ``httpx``, which the engine already requires, so the library registers cleanly in an
isolated engine.
