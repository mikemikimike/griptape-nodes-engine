"""End-to-end tests for worker->orchestrator request forwarding under reentrancy.

When a node executes off the orchestrator, every request it makes mid-execution forwards to
the orchestrator, which must service those requests while it is itself awaiting the execution
that produced them. These tests pin that machinery -- ``EventManager.forward_to_orchestrator``,
``RequestClient`` response matching, and the cross-loop dispatch topology -- without a real
websocket, using a fake broker that loops forwarded requests into a real engine's dispatch.

The topology reproduced here is the real one, because it is exactly the topology that has
bitten before (see ``configure_worker_forwarding``'s docstring): the ``RequestClient`` and its
futures live on a daemon thread's event loop, while the code that forwards runs on the main
loop, so every forward crosses loops twice. Awaiting the client's primitives from the wrong
loop historically stalled for seconds per request; the latency assertions here exist to fail
if that regression returns.

The contract these tests pin:

- **Service while awaiting**: a forwarded request is dispatched and answered while the main
  loop coroutine that sent it is still awaiting the reply.
- **Contention**: many concurrent forwards, including from foreign threads (the diffusers
  thread-pool shape), all complete, and none stalls for seconds.
- **Bounded failure**: when the orchestrator never replies, the forward raises TimeoutError
  within the configured bound instead of hanging.
