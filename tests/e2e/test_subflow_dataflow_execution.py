"""Regression test for issue #4993: data-only referenced subflows must run end to end.

A referenced workflow wired purely with data connections (Start -> ... -> End with no
control edges) runs fine on its own, because the top-level scheduler resolves terminal
data nodes and walks their dependencies backward. When the same workflow is executed as
an isolated subflow (the path SubflowWorkflowNode uses via StartLocalSubflowRequest), the
engine used to seed only the start node and walk forward *control* edges. With no control
edges to follow it resolved just the start node and silently skipped the downstream/leaf
nodes, so the End node never ran and no outputs came back, while the run still reported
success.

This test builds that exact data-only shape inside an isolated subflow and asserts the
end node resolves and its output propagates. It runs in-process (no subprocess) and drives
the real engine execution path, so a regression in the isolated-subflow DAG seeding fails
here.
