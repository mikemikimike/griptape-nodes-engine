</p>

1. Copy and securely store your token
1. Click **Done** to close the token window.

!!! danger "Security Notice"

    It is recommended to save this token in a password locker or secure notes app, so you can find it, but also keep it secure.

    Your access token is a personal identifier for requests made to Hugging Face services. Never share it with anyone, and take precautions to avoid displaying it in screenshots, videos, or during screen-sharing sessions.

    Treat it like you would a credit card number.

## Install Required Files

Now that you have a token associated with your account, you can install the Hugging Face CLI (Command Line Interface) to interact with Hugging Face from the command line.

### 1. Install the Hugging Face CLI

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
```

For more information, visit the [official CLI documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/main/en/guides/cli).

### 2. Login with Your Token

In your terminal, authenticate with the access token you made earlier:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

You'll be prompted to enter your token.

### 3. Install Models as Required

Each Hugging Face node is designed to work with specific models. While some nodes work with only one model, others are compatible with multiple options. The table below outlines which models can be used with each node:

| Node              | Compatible Model(s)        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| SPAN Upscale      | 4x-ClearRealityV1.pth      |
| Flux              | FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-schnell |
| Flux Post Upscale | FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-schnell |

## Model Installation Considerations

You have two options for model installation. Your choice depends on your specific workflow requirements, available disk space, and internet connection speed.

1. **Selective Installation**: Install only the specific models needed for the nodes you plan to use.

    - **Advantages**: Reduced download time and disk space usage.
    - **Disadvantages**: Limited functionality until additional models are installed.

1. **Complete Installation**: Download all available models.

    - **Advantages**: Full access to all node capabilities without additional downloads.
    - **Disadvantages**: Longer initial download time and greater disk space requirements.

!!! note "Download Time"

    These model downloads are quite large an may collectively take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours to complete, depending on your internet connection speed. You can continue to the last step while downloads are ongoing.

!!! info "Download Location"

    Models will be downloaded into your Hugging Face Hub Cache Directory. To see where this is, you can use the huggingface-cli, and look for HF_HUB_CACHE.

    Running this command in the terminal will produce a list with several entries

    ```
    huggingface-cli env
    ```

    Look for an entry that starts with `- HF_HUB_CACHE:`

    ```
    - HF_HUB_CACHE: /Users/jason/.cache/huggingface/hub
    ```

#### For SPAN Upscale

```bash
huggingface-cli download skbhadra/ClearRealityV1 4x-ClearRealityV1.pth
```

#### For Flux and Flux Post Upscale

```bash
huggingface-cli download black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell
```

#### For FLUX.1-dev

```bash
huggingface-cli download black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev
```

!!! warning "Download errors"

    It is possible to encounter errors during download that start like this:

    ```
    Cannot access gated repo for url https://huggingface.co...
    ```

    The end of those errors will contain a link, though, with instructions to request access.

    Follow those instructions:

    Visit [https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell) to ask for access. When that is successful you should see a message about being granted access, and you can try to download again.

## Add Your Token to Griptape Nodes settings

!!! info "Overview"

    Now that you've set up your Hugging Face account and installed the required models, you need to configure Griptape Nodes to use your token. This process is straightforward.

### 1. Open the Griptape Nodes Settings Menu

1. Launch Griptape Nodes
1. Look for the **Settings** menu located in the top menu bar (just to the right of File and Edit)
1. Click on **Settings** to open the configuration options

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/huggingface_07_GN_Settings.png" alt="Settings Menu" width="500"/>
</p>

### 2. Add your Hugging Face Token in API Keys & Secrets

1. In the Configuration Editor, locate **API Keys and Secrets** in the bottom left
1. Click to expand this section
1. Scroll down to the **HUGGINGFACE_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN** field
1. Paste your previously created token into this field
1. Close the Configuration Editor to automatically save your settings

<p align="center">

</p>

!!! success "Setup Complete"

    After completing these steps, the Hugging Face Nodes should be ready to use in Griptape Nodes!

## Controlling Model Downloads

If you manage Griptape Nodes for a team, you may want to decide which models are available instead of letting the engine and model libraries download from Hugging Face. Griptape Nodes downloads and finds models with Hugging Face's own `huggingface_hub` package and doesn't change any of its settings, so the standard Hugging Face environment variables control it. Hugging Face documents them in [Environment variables](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/environment_variables). This section covers how Griptape Nodes behaves when you set them.

### Where to set the variables

Set them in either of these places, then restart Griptape Nodes:

- The environment that launches Griptape Nodes, such as your shell profile, a service definition, or a container. Values set here take priority.
- The `.env` file in your Griptape Nodes configuration directory (commonly `~/.config/griptape_nodes/.env`). See [Configuration](../configuration.md).

The engine, its worker processes and its model download processes all use the same values.

### Block downloads

Set [`HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/environment_variables#hfhuboffline) to stop all requests to Hugging Face. Models that are already in the cache keep working. With offline mode on:

- Downloading an uncached model from **Model Management** fails with "Cannot find an appropriate cached snapshot folder for the specified revision on the local disk and outgoing traffic has been disabled." Downloading a model that is already cached succeeds without going online. The same applies to models listed in `models_to_download` in your configuration, which the engine downloads at startup.
- Searching in **Model Management** fails, because search always asks Hugging Face.
- Model dropdowns on nodes list the models in the cache. Models a node supports but that aren't cached show as "Not downloaded" and can't be run.
- Most model nodes only load from the cache, but a few fetch extra files from Hugging Face when they run. Offline mode blocks those too, so make sure every file such a node needs is already cached.

### Use a shared or managed cache

Set [`HF_HOME`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/environment_variables#hfhome) or [`HF_HUB_CACHE`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/environment_variables#hfhubcache) to point Griptape Nodes at a cache you control, such as a network share. **Model Management** lists and deletes models in that cache, and model dropdowns read from it. Hugging Face explains the cache layout in [Manage the cache](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/manage-cache).

### Pre-download models

Fill the cache ahead of time with `hf download`, described in [Download files from the Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/download) and the [CLI guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/cli). Keep in mind:

- Run it with the same `HF_HOME` or `HF_HUB_CACHE` that Griptape Nodes uses, or the models land in a different cache.
- Download the whole repository. Nodes load only what's in the cache, so a download filtered to some files can leave a model that shows up in the dropdown but fails to load.

### Use an internal mirror

`huggingface_hub` also reads `HF_ENDPOINT`, the address it downloads and searches from. Set it to an internal mirror of the Hugging Face Hub to serve models from your own server.

### Use local model files

The Modular Diffusion library's **Load Pipeline Component** node loads a component from a single checkpoint file or a local diffusers-format folder, so you can use model files that aren't in the Hugging Face cache at all.
