# Agent

The Agent is a built-in AI assistant with direct access to your workflow. Ask it questions, have it build nodes, run your workflow, or inspect what's on the canvas — all in plain conversation.

<!-- TODO(#5095): screenshot of the full sidebar showing the chat tab active, the model dropdown, and a sample conversation -->

## Open the sidebar

The sidebar lives on the right side of the Griptape Nodes canvas. Click the **chat bubble** tab (the first icon in the Sidebar Panels header) to open it.

<!-- TODO(#5095): screenshot highlighting the Sidebar Panels tabs, with the chat tab indicated -->

## Choose a model

At the top of the chat panel, click the **Model** dropdown to see all available models, grouped by provider:

<!-- TODO(#5095): screenshot of the model dropdown open, showing Griptape Cloud models at top and an Ollama section below -->

- The top group contains **Griptape Cloud** models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Llama, and more) — available by default, no setup needed
- Any additional providers you've configured appear as their own labeled sections below
- Use **Search models...** to filter by name
- Click **Manage providers...** at the bottom to open [Providers](./providers/index.md)

## Send a message

Type in the **Write a message...** input at the bottom and press **Enter** or click the send button. You can also attach files using the paperclip icon.

The agent streams its response in real time. When it takes an action — like reading your canvas or running your workflow — you'll see the step appear inline so you always know what it's doing.

For example, you can ask it to:

- **"What nodes are in my workflow?"** — it reads the canvas and tells you what's there
- **"Add a Text Input node and connect it to the Agent"** — it creates and wires the nodes for you
- **"Run my workflow and tell me what the output was"** — it executes your workflow and reports back
- **"Change the prompt on my Agent node to..."** — it updates node parameters directly
- **"Explain what this workflow does"** — it reads your workflow structure and gives you a plain-language summary

!!! tip "How does the agent control my workflow?"

    Griptape Nodes runs a built-in **MCP server** alongside the engine. MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that lets AI models call tools — in this case, tools for reading your canvas, creating nodes, running workflows, and more. The agent connects to this server automatically; there's nothing to configure.

## When a budget stops a reply

If your organization has set a spending budget on Griptape Cloud and a reply
would go over it, the agent stops and says so in the thread, in place of its
answer:

> Budget stopped this reply. It was blocked by the budget "Marketing Q3".
> Contact your Griptape administrator.

Replies, and images the agent generates, count against the budgets of the
project you have open, as well as any budget for your whole organization.

The message names every budget that blocked the reply. Bring those names to
your Griptape administrator, who can raise or unfreeze the budget on Griptape
Cloud. A budget that stops a workflow run is shown differently — see
[When a budget stops a run](../editor/running_workflows.md#when-a-budget-stops-a-run).

## What's next

- [Threads](./threads.md) — how conversations are saved and where to find them
- [Personalization](./personalization.md) — customize the agent's tone and context
- [Skills](./skills.md) — give the agent extra domain knowledge
- [External Tools (MCP Servers)](./mcp_servers.md) — connect file access, web search, and other tools to the agent
- [Providers](./providers/index.md) — add Ollama, LM Studio, or a custom endpoint
- [Using in Workflows](./using_in_workflows.md) — the Agent node for automated flows
