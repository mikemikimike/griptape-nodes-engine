# Libraries

A **library** is a bundle of nodes you can use in the editor. Some
ship with the engine, some you install from a Git URL, some you write
yourself. This page is for the artist installing and using libraries
— not the developer authoring them. (Library authors: see the
[Custom Nodes guide](../development/custom_nodes/index.md) and
[Node Isolation with Workers](../development/custom_nodes/node_isolation_with_workers.md).)

If you're worried about installing two libraries that conflict, jump
to [Coexistence guarantees](#coexistence-guarantees) — the short
answer is that two libraries' Python dependencies cannot break each
other, but two libraries with the same node name can be ambiguous
and the engine will tell you about it.

## What you start with

The engine supports a **Sandbox Library** — a scratchpad library
for quickly developing your own custom nodes without authoring a
full library. It isn't there until you set one up: under
**Settings → Library → Sandbox Settings**, point **Sandbox Library
Directory** at a folder that exists on disk. Once it does, the
engine picks up `.py` node files from that directory, and what you
see in the editor's Sandbox category depends on what's actually in
it.

The Sandbox Library can also turn your own saved workflows into
nodes. See [Turning a workflow into a node](#turning-a-workflow-into-a-node)
below.

During `gtn init`, you're offered the **Advanced Media Library**
(diffusion, image generation, video). You can register it then or
re-run `gtn init` later to add it. See the
[FAQ](../faq.md#how-do-i-install-the-advanced-media-library-after-initial-setup)
for that path.

Other libraries — first-party or community — you install yourself
through the editor.

## Installing a library (in the editor)

The editor's **Libraries** panel is the primary install surface.
Open it from the header's **Manage** menu → **Library
Management**.

Click **Add Library** (top right) to open the **Add Library**
modal. Paste a Git URL (for example a GitHub repository hosting a
community library) and click **Install**. The editor clones the
repo, reads the library's `griptape_nodes_library.json` manifest,
installs its dependencies, and registers it. **Advanced Options**
in the modal lets you pick a specific branch, tag, or commit
instead of the repository default.

Not sure what to install? The **Browse Community Libraries** button
at the bottom of the modal opens a curated list of libraries you
can install.

After a successful install, the new library appears in the panel's
library list. Each entry shows:

- The library's name and version.
- The number of nodes it provides.
- An **Open** action that opens the library's directory in your
    file manager.
- An **Advanced** disclosure that shows the library's Git remote,
    ref (branch or tag), and current commit. If you ever need to
    report a bug, the commit shown there is the precise version to
    cite.

You can filter the list by **All**, **Updates**, or **Errors**
using the chips above it. **Errors** is your first stop when
something is wrong with one of your libraries — it surfaces install
failures, dependency-install failures, and load-time failures
together.

## Updating libraries

In the same **Libraries** panel, the icon buttons next to the
filter chips let you:

- **Check for updates** — scan all installed libraries for new
    versions. Anything with an update available shows up under the
    **Updates** filter.
- **Refresh** — re-read the library list (helpful if you just
    installed something and want to confirm it took).

For ambient update awareness, **Configuration Editor → Libraries**
controls how aggressively the engine checks for library updates on
its own.

**Update Notifications** options:

- **Enable sidebar notifications** — show a badge on the Libraries
    tab and per-library buttons when an update is available.
- **Notification color / animation** — visual style for the badge.
- **Check on startup** — scan for updates each time the engine
    loads.
- **Check periodically** — repeating schedule (Never, Hourly, etc.).
- **Check Now** — trigger an immediate scan.

You don't have to configure any of this; the defaults are fine for
most artists.

## Toggling and removing libraries

The same **Configuration Editor → Libraries** view also shows
**Library Registration → Libraries To Register**. Each entry in
that list is a library the engine loads at startup. Two controls
per entry:

- The toggle (left) — flip off to keep the library on disk but stop
    loading it on engine start.
- The trash icon (right) — remove the entry entirely. The clone on
    disk stays put; delete its directory manually if you want the
    disk space back.

Where a library's nodes run is not a setting. The library declares
which of its dependencies are needed only while a node runs, and the
engine routes execution from that; see
[Process isolation](#process-isolation) below.

The **Add Library** button below lets you point the engine at a
`griptape_nodes_library.json` you already have on disk (a library
you cloned manually, or a library you're developing locally).

## Coexistence guarantees

The point of installing two libraries side-by-side is that they
can't break each other. Three layers control how well that holds:

### Python dependency isolation

Every registered library gets its own **virtual environment** — an
isolated set of Python packages that doesn't share state with the
engine's own packages or with any other library's. Library A can
pin `torch==2.4.1`; library B can pin `torch==2.0.0`. Both are
installed into separate `.venv` directories, and each library uses
its own when its nodes run.

This holds wherever a library's nodes run (see
[Process isolation](#process-isolation)): the `.venv` lives on disk
next to the library's manifest either way. The only difference is
which process loads those packages. From the artist's perspective
the dependency isolation is the same.

**You can install incompatibly-pinned libraries together without
pip resolution conflicts.** This is the most important guarantee on
this page.

#### Edit-time vs. execution dependencies

A library can split its dependencies into two sets in its manifest:

- `pip_dependencies` — **edit-time**: what's needed to show the
    library's nodes in the editor, place them on the canvas, and
    edit their parameters. Keep this set light.
- `pip_dependencies_exec` — **execution**: the heavy packages
    (torch, diffusers, and friends) that are only needed when a
    node actually *runs*.

Execution dependencies are installed into a separate environment
(`.venv-exec`, next to the library's `.venv`) and are only loaded
in the process where nodes execute — never in the main engine
process. That means a library can depend on multi-gigabyte ML
stacks while the editor stays light, and two libraries with
clashing heavy pins can still be edited side by side.

Declaring no `pip_dependencies_exec` is always safe: every
dependency is treated as edit-time, and the library installs and
runs as a single-environment library.

#### What declaring execution dependencies changes

A library that declares them runs differently, in three ways:

- **Its nodes execute in the library's own process.** The main
    engine can show, edit, and save them (it has the edit-time
    dependencies), but running them happens where the heavy
    packages live. If that process isn't up yet, running the node
    reports that rather than failing strangely.
- **Node code asks the engine for state instead of reading it.**
    Inside `process()`, reaching for a manager directly (config,
    secrets, files) raises an error telling you the request to use
    instead. The library's process holds no settings or secrets of
    its own, so a direct read would be answering from the wrong
    place. Saving static files still works normally.
- **Values without a plain-data form stay in the process that
    built them.** Mark such an output `serializable=False` (a live
    model handle, a tensor) and the engine keeps the object in the
    library's process, sending the next node a reference to it. An
    output with no plain-data form that isn't marked fails the node
    with an error that names it.

### Process isolation

A library that declares execution dependencies runs its nodes in its
own process, which also gives you:

- **Fault tolerance.** If the library crashes while running a node,
    only that library goes down — the rest of the engine keeps
    running.
- **Resource isolation.** Anything the library loads into memory
    (model weights, GPU memory, background threads) lives in the
    library's own process and can't degrade other libraries.

Heavy ML libraries (diffusion, transformers, custom CUDA stacks) are
the ones that declare execution dependencies; lightweight libraries
(simple HTTP / data nodes) have none to declare and run in the main
engine process. This is the library author's call, made in
`griptape_nodes_library.json` — see
[Node Isolation with Workers](../development/custom_nodes/node_isolation_with_workers.md)
for the schema. There is nothing for an artist to configure.

### Node-name collisions: not solved

If two libraries register a node class with the same name (e.g.
both ship a `MyImageNode`), the engine accepts both. **The engine
does not warn you at install time.** When you create that node:

- If your workflow names the library explicitly, it works.
- If it doesn't, the engine raises an error listing both libraries
    so you can disambiguate.

This is the one coexistence concern the engine doesn't solve for
you. If you suspect a collision, the safest fix is to remove the
library you don't want from the **Libraries To Register** list.

## When something goes wrong

### "I installed the library but I don't see its nodes"

Open the **Libraries** panel and switch the filter to **Errors**.
That's the consolidated view of every library that failed to
install, failed to install dependencies, or failed to load. Click
into the offending library for the specific error message.

Common causes:

- The library pins a wheel (a pre-built Python package) that
    doesn't exist for your Python version or platform — for example a
    `torch` wheel for an unsupported CUDA version.
- Your network blocked the install (corporate proxy, or no internet
    during the install step).
- Disk full (the engine reports this explicitly).

Fix the underlying issue, then re-trigger the install (re-paste the
URL in the **Add Library** modal, or use the CLI alternative below
with `--overwrite`).

### "A node looks broken or red in the editor"

The engine couldn't construct that node — usually because its
library failed to load. The editor swaps in a placeholder so your
workflow file isn't corrupted. Check the **Errors** filter in the
**Libraries** panel for the underlying load error; once you fix it,
reopening the workflow uses the real node again.

### Looking for the raw error text

The terminal window where the engine is running (the same window
you launched the engine from) carries the verbose error log,
including stack traces. Errors raised while a node runs in a
library's own process appear there with a `Worker-<id>` prefix.

## CLI alternatives

If you'd rather use the command line — for automation, headless
engines, or just preference — the editor's library actions have
`gtn` equivalents:

| Editor action                       | CLI equivalent                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Add Library → Install               | `gtn libraries download <git_url>` |
| Check for updates → install pending | `gtn libraries sync`               |
| Sync over local edits               | `gtn libraries sync --overwrite`   |
| Re-register Advanced Media Library  | `gtn init`, answer `y`             |

See [Command Line Interface](../reference/command_line_interface.md) for the
full reference.

## Turning a workflow into a node

Any saved workflow you put in your sandbox folder (the **Sandbox
Library Directory** under **Settings → Library → Sandbox Settings**)
shows up in the node chooser as a node. You'll find it in the
**Sandbox Library**, under the **Sandbox** heading, next to any
custom nodes you're developing there. Treat it like any other node
in development: once it's settled, it can move into a library of
its own.

To qualify, the workflow needs a **Start Flow** node and an **End
Flow** node. The Start Flow node's parameters become the node's
inputs and the End Flow node's parameters become its outputs, so
what you wire into the node is what the workflow receives, and what
the workflow finishes with is what the node hands on.

The node's name comes from the workflow's name: `shout_workflow`
becomes **ShoutWorkflow**. Its display name and description in the
node chooser come from the workflow's own name and description.

A few things worth knowing:

- **Changes show up when libraries load.** The sandbox folder is
    read when the engine starts and each time you choose **Refresh
    Libraries**. A workflow you add, edit, or remove in between isn't
    picked up until then.
- **Renaming a workflow gives you a different node.** Because the
    node's name comes from the workflow's name, changing the
    workflow's name turns it into a new node. Workflows that were
    already using the old node won't find it any more.
- **Publishing doesn't take the workflow with it.** A workflow that
    uses one of these nodes won't run on another installation unless
    the workflow behind the node is there too.
- **Problems show up in the Libraries panel.** If a workflow can't
    become a node (it has no Start Flow or End Flow node, or its
    saved details can't be read), the **Sandbox Library** entry in
    the **Libraries** panel says why. Fix it, save it, then choose
    **Refresh Libraries**.
- **A workflow and a custom node can't share a name.** If a
    workflow's node name matches a custom node in the sandbox, the
    workflow's node takes the name and the custom node is left out.
    The **Sandbox Library** entry shows a duplicate-name problem.
    Rename one of them, then choose **Refresh Libraries**.

## Where libraries are stored on disk

- **Config**: `~/.config/griptape_nodes/griptape_nodes_config.json`
    (or the platform equivalent — see
    [Engine Configuration](configuration.md)). The
    `app_events.on_app_initialization_complete.libraries_to_register`
    list inside it is what the editor's Libraries To Register list
    edits.
- **Clones / venvs**: in the directory the editor cloned the
    library into; the library's `.venv` lives next to its
    `griptape_nodes_library.json`.
- **Sandbox library**: the sandbox directory is configured
    separately in your settings; defaults vary by platform.

To pin a project to specific library versions (so activating it provisions
and, if needed, overwrites libraries to match), see
[Pinning engine and library versions](projects/version_pinning.md).
