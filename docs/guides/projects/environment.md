# Environment & Builtin Variables

## Environment

The `environment` section of a project file holds custom key-value pairs. These values are available for use in macros and directory `path_macro` fields.

```yaml
environment:
  RENDER_STYLE: "realistic"
  CLIENT_CODE: "ACME"
```

### Overlay behavior

Environment entries from your project file are merged on top of the system defaults. If a key exists in the defaults, your value replaces it. New keys are added.

### Referencing other variables from an environment value

Environment values are macros themselves. A value can reference a builtin, a directory, another project environment variable, or a shell environment variable by using `{NAME}`:

Assume the shell that launched Griptape Nodes has `SHARED_DRIVE=/mnt/renders` exported. Then:

```yaml
directories:
  outputs:
    # Reference a shell env var directly — no need to declare it under `environment:`
    path_macro: "{SHARED_DRIVE}/outputs"

environment:
  CLIENT_CODE: "ACME"
  # Reference a builtin
  PROJECT_RENDERS: "{project_dir}/renders"
  # Compose a shell env var, a project env var, and literal text
  CLIENT_RENDERS: "{SHARED_DRIVE}/{CLIENT_CODE}/renders"
```

References are resolved recursively, following the priority order in [Variable priority](#variable-priority). Cycles (for example, `A: "{B}"` and `B: "{A}"`) are detected and surfaced as macro resolution errors.

#### Legacy `$VAR` syntax

For backwards compatibility, an environment value that is **exactly** `$NAME` (no surrounding text, no suffix, no other macros) is expanded using the operating-system environment **when the value is consumed by a macro**:

```yaml
environment:
  OUTPUT_ROOT: "$RENDER_FARM_SHARE"  # works in macros: {OUTPUT_ROOT} -> /mnt/renders
```

Important limitations — the `$VAR` form is narrow and has known gaps:

- **Whole value only.** Anything appended (for example `"$SHARED_DRIVE/outputs"`) or any adjacent text is **not** expanded and is treated as a literal string. Macro resolution will fail looking up the entire trailing string as a secret name.
- **Macro-only, not process.** `$VAR` is only expanded at macro resolution time. It is **not** expanded when the value is written to `os.environ` — subprocesses and nodes calling `os.environ.get("OUTPUT_ROOT")` will see the literal string `"$RENDER_FARM_SHARE"`, not the expanded value.
- **Cannot be composed.** A `$`-prefixed value cannot reference another project env var, a builtin, or a directory.

Prefer the `{NAME}` form for all new projects — it composes cleanly, expands consistently in macros **and** `os.environ`, and works in both `environment` values and directory `path_macro` fields.

## Builtin variables

Builtin variables are automatically available in all macros. You do not define them — the system provides their values at runtime. They cannot be overridden.

| Variable           | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project_dir`      | directory | Absolute path to the project base directory (the folder containing `griptape-nodes-project.yml`, or the workspace directory when no project file is present)                                 |
| `workspace_dir`    | directory | Absolute path to the workspace directory (defaults to the project directory when no explicit workspace is configured; see [Workspace](workspace.md#config-resolution-order))                 |
| `workflow_name`    | string    | Name of the currently running workflow                                                                                                                                                       |
| `workflow_dir`     | directory | Absolute path to the directory containing the current workflow file. For a workflow that has not been saved yet: the folder it was created in, or the folder its first save would default to |
| `static_files_dir` | string    | Name of the static files subdirectory (from settings, defaults to `staticfiles`)                                                                                                             |

### How builtins are resolved

Builtins are resolved at the moment a macro is evaluated — not when the project file is loaded. This means:

- `workflow_name` and `workflow_dir` reflect whichever workflow is currently executing
- `project_dir` reflects the actual path of the loaded project file
- `workspace_dir` reflects the project directory when no explicit workspace is configured, otherwise the value from the project-adjacent config or environment variable

If a builtin variable is required but cannot be resolved (for example, `workflow_name` when no workflow is running), macro resolution fails with an error. If the variable is optional (marked with `?`), the block is silently omitted instead.

### Builtin variables in situation macros

The `save_static_file` situation uses `workflow_dir` and `static_files_dir`:

```
{workflow_dir?:/}{static_files_dir}/{file_name_base}.{file_extension}
```

If `workflow_dir` is available, the static files go into a subdirectory of the workflow folder. If not, the `{workflow_dir?:/}` block is omitted and the path becomes workspace-relative.

### Unsaved workflows

A workflow that has never been saved has no file, so there is no directory to derive `workflow_dir` from. When you create a workflow while browsing a folder, the editor tells the engine which folder that was, and `workflow_dir` answers with it until the workflow is saved. Files you generate before the first save land in that folder rather than at the workspace root.

Once the workflow is saved, `workflow_dir` switches to the directory of the saved file — which may be somewhere else, if you saved it to a different folder. The files themselves stay where they were written, but any stored references built on `{workflow_dir}` now resolve into the new folder, so outputs generated before the save may appear missing from the node even though the bytes are on disk.

If the editor did not supply a folder, `workflow_dir` answers with the folder your first save would default to. That is the folder named by your project's `save_workflow` situation, which is the workspace directory unless your project points workflow saves somewhere else. Files you generate before saving land there.

## Variable priority

When a macro is resolved, variables are supplied from these sources in priority order:

1. **Builtin variables** — always win; cannot be overridden by any other source
1. **Directory names** — resolved from the project's directory definitions; cannot be overridden by caller-supplied variables
1. **Caller-supplied variables** — values passed by the node or operation requesting path resolution
1. **Derived variables** — computed from the variables above plus project state, and injected before the situation macro is resolved. A derived variable abstains when the caller has already supplied its value, so caller-supplied entries still win.
1. **Project variables** — values from the project's `variables:` block (see [Project Variables](variables.md)). Only string and integer values participate.
1. **Project environment variables** — values from the project's `environment:` block. Recursively resolved, so a project env value can reference builtins, directory names, other project env vars, or shell env vars.
1. **Shell environment variables** — final fallback. Any variable set in the shell that launched Griptape Nodes (including `HOME`, `USER`, or anything the user exported) can be referenced with `{NAME}` in a macro. A project env var of the same name always wins. Reserved names (builtins, directories) silently win over the shell, since shells have many incidental variables that shouldn't shadow project state.

If a caller tries to supply a value for a builtin or directory name that differs from the system value, the resolution fails with a `RESERVED_NAME_COLLISION` error.

### Derived variables

| Variable                   | Derived from                                                             | Source of truth                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `file_extension_directory` | `file_extension` plus the project's `file_extension_directories` mapping | See [File Extension Directories](file_extension_directories.md) |
