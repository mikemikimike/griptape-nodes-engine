# Best Practices and Error Handling

General best practices for production-quality nodes: secrets, imports, code quality, error handling, validation, and logging.

## Best Practices

### Core Principles

- **Descriptive names and tooltips**
- **Robust error handling with validators**
- **Single responsibility per node**
- **Use `SecretsManager` for API keys and secrets**
- **Import all dependencies at module level**
- **Idempotent process methods**

### Secrets Management

Read secrets with `GetSecretValueRequest`:

```python
from griptape_nodes.retained_mode.events.secrets_events import (
    GetSecretValueRequest,
    GetSecretValueResultSuccess,
)
from griptape_nodes.retained_mode.griptape_nodes import GriptapeNodes


class MyNode(DataNode):
    SERVICE_NAME = "MyService"
    API_KEY_NAME = "MY_SERVICE_API_KEY"

    def _validate_api_key(self) -> str:
        result = GriptapeNodes.handle_request(GetSecretValueRequest(key=self.API_KEY_NAME))
        if not isinstance(result, GetSecretValueResultSuccess) or not result.value:
            raise ValueError(f"Missing {self.API_KEY_NAME}")
        return result.value
```

**Key Points:**

- Import at module level, not inside functions
- Use a request rather than `GriptapeNodes.SecretsManager()`. The manager accessor is
    **refused while a node executes in a worker**, and a helper like this is reachable from
    both `process` (in the worker) and validation (in the orchestrator) — so the manager
    version works in one caller and raises in the other. The request is correct in both.
- Define `API_KEY_NAME` as a class constant for consistency
- Always validate that the secret exists before using it

### Parameter Payload Size

A parameter value can end up fully embedded in two places:

- **Saved workflow files.** The workflow serializer writes unique parameter values inline into the saved `.py` file, with no size limit — whatever Python state the value holds gets written out whole.
- **WebSocket events.** Parameter values traveling in request/response events are serialized and sent to every connected client (the editor UI, the MCP server).

Neither path checks the size of the value first, so by default a large value bloats both the saved workflow file and the traffic to every connected client. Store large binary data (images, audio, video, 3D assets, model weights) by reference — a file path or URL — rather than inlining the bytes, wherever the node's underlying API allows it.

`Parameter(serializable=False)` (see [Parameter Attributes](parameters.md#parameter-attributes)) covers **only the first path**. It keeps a value out of saved workflow files — the right choice for values that should never persist, such as drivers, file handles, and large transient buffers — but it has no effect on the second: the value is still sent to every connected client. There is no per-parameter opt-out of the WebSocket path, so keeping the value small is the only lever you have over it. On an output, the same declaration additionally holds the value in the process that produced it and sends only a key across a worker process boundary - see [Passing Values That Cannot Be Serialized](passing_unserializable_values.md).

!!! warning "Keep parameter values small"

    `griptape.artifacts.BlobArtifact` stores raw bytes, and `ImageArtifact` / `AudioArtifact` both subclass it — so a node using one of these as a parameter type sends the entire byte payload to every connected client, and writes it into saved workflows unless the parameter is declared `serializable=False`. Use `ImageUrlArtifact` / `AudioUrlArtifact` instead (the `ParameterImage` / `ParameterAudio` helper classes enforce them — see [Parameters](parameters.md#parameterimage-recommended-for-image-parameters)), which hold only a short URL string no matter how large the file they point to is.

    Raw bytes aren't confined to `BlobArtifact` and its subclasses — `ThreeDArtifact` holds them too (though does not send its bytes over the WebSocket). Judge a parameter by the size of the value it will actually hold, not by whether its type name looks safe.

### Import Best Practices

**Always import dependencies at module level, not inside functions:**

❌ **Bad** - Conditional/lazy imports:

```python
def _get_image_data(self, image_artifact):
    try:
        from PIL import Image  # Don't do this
        from io import BytesIO
        img = Image.open(BytesIO(image_bytes))
```

✅ **Good** - Module-level imports:

```python
# At top of file
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO


def _get_image_data(self, image_artifact):
    img = Image.open(BytesIO(image_bytes))
```

**Why?**

- Makes dependencies clear and visible
- Avoids redundant imports throughout the file
- Follows Python best practices (PEP 8)
- Easier to catch missing dependencies early
- Better IDE support and code completion

**Exception**: Only use conditional imports for truly optional dependencies that may not be installed:

```python
def process(self) -> None:
    try:
        from huggingface_hub import HfApi
    except ImportError:
        error_msg = "huggingface_hub library not installed"
        self.parameter_output_values["output"] = None
        raise ImportError(error_msg)
```

### Import Organization

Organize imports in standard order with blank lines between groups:

```python
# Standard library imports
import base64
import logging
from typing import Any

# Third-party imports
import requests
from PIL import Image

# Local/Griptape imports
from griptape_nodes.exe_types.core_types import Parameter, ParameterMode
from griptape_nodes.exe_types.node_types import DataNode
from griptape_nodes.retained_mode.griptape_nodes import GriptapeNodes
```

### Type Checking for Third-Party Libraries

When importing third-party libraries, you may encounter type checking errors. Use the appropriate `type: ignore` comment based on the situation:

#### Scenario 1: Library Installed but Missing Type Stubs

For libraries that are installed but lack type annotations (like `sklearn`, `ultralytics`, `supervision`):

```python
# ✅ Library exists but has no type stubs
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans  # type: ignore[import-untyped]
from ultralytics import YOLO  # type: ignore[import-untyped]
from supervision import Detections  # type: ignore[import-untyped]
```

#### Scenario 2: Library Not Installed in CI Type Checking Environment

For libraries that are runtime dependencies but not installed in the CI type checking environment (like `color-matcher`, specialized processing libraries):

```python
# ✅ Library not installed in type checking environment
from color_matcher import ColorMatcher  # type: ignore[reportMissingImports]
from color_matcher.normalizations import norm_img_to_uint8  # type: ignore[reportMissingImports]
```

#### When to Use Which

| Error Type             | Comment                                | Use When                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `import-untyped`       | `# type: ignore[import-untyped]`       | Library installed, no type stubs |
| `reportMissingImports` | `# type: ignore[reportMissingImports]` | Library not in CI environment    |

**General guidance:**

- `import-untyped` is preferred when both work - it's more precise
- `reportMissingImports` is necessary when the library isn't available during type checking
- Check CI logs to determine which error you're actually getting

### Function Parameter Management

Keep function argument counts low (under 6) by using dataclasses:

❌ **Bad** - Too many parameters:

```python
def process_bbox(self, x: int, y: int, width: int, height: int,
                 dilation_percent: float, img_width: int, img_height: int):
    # Process bounding box
```

✅ **Good** - Use dataclass:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class BoundingBox:
    x: int
    y: int
    width: int
    height: int
    dilation_percent: float
    img_width: int
    img_height: int

def process_bbox(self, bbox: BoundingBox):
    # Process bounding box using bbox.x, bbox.y, etc.
```

**Benefits:**

- Improved readability
- Type safety
- Easier to maintain
- Self-documenting code

### Code Quality

**Additional linting best practices:**

- Remove trailing whitespace from all lines (including blank lines)
- Use consistent indentation (spaces only, no tabs)
- Keep lines under 120 characters when possible
- Use descriptive variable names
- Avoid adding unnecessary Python packaging scaffolding. Create `__init__.py` files only when you actually want a package (or need them for your chosen packaging approach).

#### Pre-commit checks (required)

Before committing in `griptape-nodes`, run formatting and checks and fix any errors:

```bash
make format
make check/lint
make check/types
```

#### Node docs + navigation

When adding a new node to the core library, also add node reference documentation:

- Create a docs page at: `docs/nodes/<category>/<node>.md`
- Add it to `mkdocs.yml` under: `nav -> Nodes Reference -> <Category>`

#### Common gotchas

- Repo-wide lint/type checks can surface issues in **untracked** files too. Avoid leaving untracked folders/files in the repo (for example, copied scratch folders) when running checks or preparing a PR.
- If ruff flags function complexity (e.g., `C901`, `PLR0912`), prefer refactoring into smaller helpers over suppressing.
- **`parent_container_name` ≠ `parent_element_name`**: These two `Parameter` attributes look similar but serve completely different purposes. `parent_container_name` is for `ParameterContainer` (list/dictionary ownership), `parent_element_name` is for `ParameterGroup` (UI grouping). Mixing them up causes parameters to land at the node root, skip cleanup between runs, and silently vanish on save/reload. See the [Containers](parameters.md#containers) section for the full distinction.

## Production Error Handling

### Writing Error Messages

When a node fails, the editor shows the node's name and the exception type next to your message.
Write the message for an artist and leave out what the editor already shows:

- **Don't start with the node's name.** The editor knows which node failed. The engine removes a
    leading `"{self.name}: "` for you, but new code shouldn't add it.
- **Say what went wrong and what to do about it.** "Image is required for editing. Connect an
    image to 'Input Image'." is better than "Invalid input."
- **Don't paste a provider's response into the message.** A dumped dictionary buries the reason.
    Attach it with `NodeError` instead (below).

❌ **Bad** - name prefix and a dumped response:

```python
raise RuntimeError(f"{self.name}: Processing failed.\n\nFull API response:\n{response_json}")
```

✅ **Good** - `NodeError` with the reason in the message and the rest attached:

```python
from griptape_nodes.exe_types.core_types import NodeError, NodeErrorLink

raise NodeError(
    f"Processing failed: {response_json['status_detail']['details']}",
    fields={"generation_id": response_json["generation_id"]},
    response=response_json,
)
```

`NodeError` takes three optional keyword arguments. The editor shows each one in its own place in
the error panel:

| Argument   | What it's for                                                                                                          | Limits                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fields`   | Labelled values a user may need to quote to support, such as a request ID.                                             | Text or number values.                                                                  |
| `response` | The provider's response body, so the details are there if someone needs them.                                          | Body only, never headers. Dropped if over 16 KB or not JSON.                            |
| `links`    | `NodeErrorLink(label=..., url=...)` pages that explain the failure, or places in the editor where the user can fix it. | Up to 3. `http`, `https`, or `#` for a place in the editor. Labels up to 80 characters. |

```python
raise NodeError(
    "Image format 'image/heic' is not supported.",
    links=[
        NodeErrorLink(label="Supported image formats", url="https://docs.griptapenodes.com/nodes/load-image#formats")
    ],
)
```

Anything over a limit is dropped and the rest of the error still reaches the editor. `NodeError`
works the same way when the node runs in a worker. Other exception types still work, and their
message and type are shown, but the editor only reads `fields`, `response`, and `links` from a
`NodeError`.

#### Common failures

- **A call to a service raises.** Catch the SDK's own exception and re-raise it with
    `raise NodeError(...) from e`. `from e` keeps the original traceback in the logs. Use the
    provider's explanation as the message, and put the status code and request ID in `fields`.
- **A required API key is missing.** Check it in `validate_before_node_run`, so the node fails
    before it starts. Name the exact key and say to add it in **Settings → API Keys & Secrets**.
    A validation exception can be a `NodeError` too, so it can carry a link. A link that starts
    with `#` opens a place in the editor, so the user can go straight to the key:
    `NodeErrorLink(label="Add the API key", url=f"#settings-secrets?filter={quote(API_KEY_NAME)}")`,
    with `quote` from `urllib.parse`. The editor decides which `#` links it opens, and only
    follows ones that go somewhere, never ones that change anything.
- **Polling gives up.** Say how long the node waited and what to do next. Put the job or
    generation ID in `fields` so the user can check on it later.
- **The response contains image data.** Remove base64 data from a response before attaching it.
    A response over 16 KB is dropped, and the user only sees that there was one.
- **The user clicks "Stop".** That isn't a failure, so don't report it as one. Don't catch
    `asyncio.CancelledError` or `BaseException`. `except Exception` lets cancellation through.

To see each kind of failure in the editor, copy
[example_node_error_node.py](example_node_error_node.py) into your sandbox library folder, add the
node to a flow, pick a "Failure", and run it. It covers a failed provider job, a rejected HTTP
request, an unsupported input, a missing API key, a plain `KeyError`, and validation problems.

### Comprehensive Validation

Use `validate_before_node_run()` for complex validation:

```python
def validate_before_node_run(self) -> list[Exception] | None:
    """Validate parameters before running the node."""
    exceptions = []

    model = self.get_parameter_value("model")
    if model == "advanced":
        images = self.get_parameter_list_value("images") or []
        if len(images) > MAX_IMAGES:
            exceptions.append(ValueError(f"Maximum {MAX_IMAGES} images allowed, got {len(images)}"))

    return exceptions if exceptions else None
```

### Connection Validation Patterns

For complex nodes with multiple connection requirements:

```python
def _validate_iterative_connections(self) -> list[Exception]:
    """Validate that all required connections are properly established."""
    errors = []
    node_type = self._get_base_node_type_name()

    # Check if exec_out has outgoing connections
    if not _outgoing_connection_exists(self.name, self.exec_out.name):
        errors.append(
            Exception(
                "Missing required connection from 'On Each Item'. "
                f"REQUIRED ACTION: Connect {node_type} Start to interior loop nodes. "
                "The start node must connect to other nodes to execute the loop body."
            )
        )

    # Check if loop has outgoing connection to End
    if self.end_node is None:
        errors.append(
            Exception(
                "Missing required tethering connection. "
                f"REQUIRED ACTION: Connect {node_type} Start 'Loop End Node' to {node_type} End 'Loop Start Node'. "
                "This establishes the explicit relationship between start and end nodes."
            )
        )

    return errors
```

**Best Practice**: Provide detailed, actionable error messages that tell users exactly what connections are missing and how to fix them. The editor lists each returned exception on its own line, so return one exception per problem rather than joining them into one message.

### Safe Defaults Pattern

Always set safe defaults before raising exceptions:

```python
def _set_safe_defaults(self) -> None:
    """Set safe default values for all outputs."""
    self.parameter_output_values["result"] = None
    self.parameter_output_values["status"] = "error"
    self.parameter_output_values["count"] = 0


def process(self) -> None:
    try:
        # Processing logic
        result = process_data()
        self.parameter_output_values["result"] = result
    except Exception as e:
        self._set_safe_defaults()
        raise RuntimeError(f"Processing failed: {str(e)}") from e
```

### URL Construction

Use `urllib.parse.urljoin()` for safe URL building:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin
import os


def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(**kwargs)

    # Safe URL construction
    base = os.getenv("API_BASE_URL", "https://api.example.com")
    base_slash = base if base.endswith("/") else base + "/"
    api_base = urljoin(base_slash, "api/")
    self._endpoint = urljoin(api_base, "v1/process/")
```

## Logging Best Practices

### Safe Logging Pattern

Prevent logging failures from breaking execution:

```python
from contextlib import suppress
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def _log(self, message: str) -> None:
    """Safe logging with exception suppression."""
    with suppress(Exception):
        logger.info(message)
```

### Request Sanitization

Sanitize sensitive data in logs:

```python
from copy import deepcopy
import json

PROMPT_TRUNCATE_LENGTH = 100


def _log_request(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    """Log request with sanitized sensitive data."""
    with suppress(Exception):
        sanitized_payload = deepcopy(payload)

        # Truncate long prompts
        prompt = sanitized_payload.get("prompt", "")
        if len(prompt) > PROMPT_TRUNCATE_LENGTH:
            sanitized_payload["prompt"] = prompt[:PROMPT_TRUNCATE_LENGTH] + "..."

        # Redact base64 image data
        if "image" in sanitized_payload:
            image_data = sanitized_payload["image"]
            if isinstance(image_data, str) and image_data.startswith("data:image/"):
                parts = image_data.split(",", 1)
                header = parts[0] if parts else "data:image/"
                b64_len = len(parts[1]) if len(parts) > 1 else 0
                sanitized_payload["image"] = f"{header},<base64 data length={b64_len}>"

        self._log(f"Request: {json.dumps(sanitized_payload, indent=2)}")
```
