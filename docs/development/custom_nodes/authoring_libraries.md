# Authoring Libraries

Nodes are distributed as libraries. This page covers the library manifest (`griptape_nodes_library.json`), declarations, dependency management, documentation conventions, and the process for contributing nodes to the standard library.

## Creating Node Libraries

Bundle nodes into libraries for sharing. Create `griptape_nodes_library.json`:

```json

  "name": "Library Name",
  "library_schema_version": "0.11.0",

### Library Structure

- **settings**: Register secrets/API keys used by library nodes
    - Use `secrets_to_register` array to declare required secrets
    - Category should be `app_events.on_app_initialization_complete`
    - Secrets are read with `GriptapeNodes.handle_request(GetSecretValueRequest(key=...))`
- **metadata.dependencies**: PIP packages installed on library load
- **metadata.declarations** / per-node **metadata.declarations**: typed identity properties (lifecycle stage, arbitrary Python execution) and a library-level model catalog plus per-node references into it. See [Library and Node Declarations](#library-and-node-declarations) below.
- **beta_features**: Experimental features users can turn on from the editor's Beta Features page. See [Beta Features](#beta-features) below.
- **widgets**: Register custom JS widget components (see [Custom Widgets](custom_widgets.md))
- **categories**: Group nodes in UI with colors and icons
- **nodes**: List node classes, file paths, and metadata
- **advanced_library_path**: Optional Python file declaring an `AdvancedNodeLibrary` subclass, for libraries that need to run code at load and unload, own a request type, or register node types the manifest does not list (see [Advanced Libraries](advanced_libraries.md))
- **workflow_nodes**: Nodes generated from saved workflow files instead of Python classes. See [Nodes From Workflow Files](#nodes-from-workflow-files) below.
- **workflows**: Template workflow files

**Important:** The `secrets_to_register` array tells the system which secrets your library needs. Users will be prompted to configure these secrets through the UI or environment variables.

Use flat directory structures. The engine automatically registers and loads libraries.

### Nodes From Workflow Files

A node does not have to be a Python class. Point a `workflow_nodes` entry at a saved workflow and the
engine generates the node type for you:

```jsonc
"workflow_nodes": [
  {
    "node_type": "UpscaleAndTag",
    "workflow_path": "workflows/upscale_and_tag.py",
    "metadata": {
      "category": "image",
      "description": "Upscales an image and tags it",
      "display_name": "Upscale and Tag"
    }
  }
]
```

| Field           | Meaning                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node_type`     | The name the node is registered under. This is what appears in saved workflows.                |
| `workflow_path` | Path to the saved workflow `.py`, relative to `griptape_nodes_library.json`.                   |
| `metadata`      | The same node metadata block the `nodes` array uses: category, description, display name, etc. |

**The workflow needs a Start Flow node and an End Flow node.** Those are what define the node's
parameters:

- Every non-control parameter on a **Start Flow** node becomes an **input** on the node.
- Every non-control parameter on an **End Flow** node becomes an **output** on the node.
- The node supplies its own Flow In and Flow Out, so the workflow's control parameters are not
    surfaced.
- The End Flow node's built-in **Status** parameters (`was_successful`, `result_details`) are not
    surfaced either. They report on the End Flow node's own run, not on anything you exposed. A
    parameter of your own with one of those names is only dropped if you also put it in a parameter
    group named `Status`.

A parameter name used by exactly one Start Flow or End Flow node keeps its bare name. If two Start
Flow nodes both expose `prompt`, both parameters are qualified with their node name instead
(`Start_Flow.prompt`, `Start_Flow_2.prompt`) so neither is lost. Spaces in the node name become
underscores, because parameter names cannot contain whitespace. A name that appears on both a Start
Flow node and an End Flow node becomes a single parameter that is both an input and an output.

When the node runs, the engine loads the workflow as a child subflow of the node's own flow, copies
the node's input values onto the Start Flow nodes, runs it, and copies the End Flow values back out
as the node's outputs. The subflow is reused for later runs in the same session and is never written
into a saved workflow, so your users' files carry the node, not a copy of the workflow behind it.

**Save the workflow from the editor before shipping it.** The parameter shape is read out of the
metadata header at the top of the workflow file, which the editor writes on save. A workflow with no
saved shape (no Start Flow and End Flow nodes, or a hand-written file with no header) is reported as
a library problem and its node is not registered.

The workflow is also registered as a workflow in its own right, so it shows up in the editor's
workflow picker. To keep a workflow that only exists to back a node out of that list, set
`is_internal = true` in its metadata header.

### Library and Node Declarations

Declarations attach typed metadata to a library or to an individual node. Each entry in a `declarations` array is an object with a `type` discriminator that selects a declaration class. Today's vocabulary covers a lifecycle-stage property, a library-level model catalog with per-node references, and an arbitrary-Python-execution property; future engine releases add more declaration types under the same field.

Both `metadata.declarations` (library-level) and per-node `metadata.declarations` accept a list. Order in the list does not matter. The field defaults to `[]`, so libraries on older schema versions (`0.6.0`, `0.4.0`, `0.1.0`) load unchanged.

#### `lifecycle_stage`

Lifecycle stage for a library or for a specific node. Values:

| Value        | Meaning                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `STABLE`     | Mature; intended for production use.                                |
| `BETA`       | Feature-complete but still hardening.                               |
| `ALPHA`      | Early implementation; expect breaking changes.                      |
| `LABS`       | Exploratory; may be removed.                                        |
| `DEPRECATED` | Slated for removal; existing usage should migrate to a replacement. |

Semantics:

- **Library-level absence is intentionally distinct from `STABLE`.** A library with no `lifecycle_stage` declaration is "unstated" — consumers should surface that explicitly (`<No lifecycle stage provided by library author>`) rather than silently assume `STABLE`.
- **Node-level absence means "inherit the library's stage."** A node-level `lifecycle_stage` overrides the library's value.

#### `model_catalog`

A library-level declaration of the third-party models nodes in the library can use, organized as a `provider → model` registry. Identifiers at both levels are dict keys (the key *is* the stable handle used by node references and admin policies); each entry carries a `display_name` for UI plus optional `terms_url` and `notes`. Each `Model` additionally declares `key_support` (required), an optional `family` grouping tag, and an optional upstream `provider_model_id`.

The `key_support` value tells admins what kind of API key authorizes the call:

| Value                                   | Meaning                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `REQUIRES_CUSTOMER_KEY`                 | Customer-supplied API key only.                                                     |
| `SUPPORTS_CUSTOMER_KEY_OR_GRIPTAPE_KEY` | Customer key or Griptape-provided key both work.                                    |
| `REQUIRES_GRIPTAPE_KEY`                 | Griptape-provided key only.                                                         |
| `NO_KEY_REQUIRED`                       | The model runs locally or otherwise needs no API key (e.g. an Ollama-hosted model). |

`notes` (available on both the provider and the model) is free-form author guidance rendered alongside the entry. Use it for caveats that don't fit other fields, like "BYOK requires injecting a provider-specific prompt driver."

```jsonc
{
  "type": "model_catalog",
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": {
      "display_name": "Anthropic",
      "terms_url": "https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms",
      "models": {
        "claude_opus_byok": {
          "display_name": "Claude Opus 4 (BYOK)",
          "family": "Claude 4",
          "provider_model_id": "claude-opus-4",
          "key_support": "REQUIRES_CUSTOMER_KEY"
        },
        "claude_opus_griptape": {
          "display_name": "Claude Opus 4 (Griptape Key)",
          "family": "Claude 4",
          "provider_model_id": "claude-opus-4",
          "key_support": "REQUIRES_GRIPTAPE_KEY"
        }
      }
    },
    "kling": {
      "display_name": "Kling",
      "terms_url": "https://app.klingai.com/global/about/terms",
      "models": {
        "kling_v2": {
          "display_name": "Kling v2",
          "provider_model_id": "kling-v2-master",
          "key_support": "REQUIRES_GRIPTAPE_KEY"
        }
      }
    },
    "ollama": {
      "display_name": "Ollama",
      "key_support": "NO_KEY_REQUIRED",
      "notes": "Local runtime; models enumerated at runtime, none declared here."
    }
  }
}
```

A few rules worth knowing:

- **`family` is just a tag.** It clusters related models for display (e.g. the two Claude 4 entries above). It is not a container and is not part of a model's identity, so providers without meaningful families simply omit it.
- **`key_support` lives on the model by default.** Every `Model` declares its own value. The same upstream model with two different key requirements becomes two models under two distinct dict keys (see `claude_opus_byok` and `claude_opus_griptape` above). A `ModelProvider` also accepts an optional `key_support` used only when it declares no models at all (e.g. a local-runtime provider like Ollama where `key_support=NO_KEY_REQUIRED` is the only meaningful signal).
- **Model IDs must be unique across the entire library.** Pydantic enforces uniqueness within each provider's `models` dict for free; collisions across providers are caught at library-load time as `DuplicateModelIdProblem`.
- **At most one `model_catalog` per library.** Declaring two is rejected at validation time; merge their providers into one.

A node's model-selection dropdown stores the provider's own model id (`kling-v2-master`, not `Kling v2`), and `ModelAccessComponent` resolves it to the catalog key that the permission layer gates on. Storing a display name instead means the selection cannot be resolved, so it cannot be checked against license policy. If a dropdown historically stored something else, migrate those saved values with the component's `deprecated_values` mapping rather than renaming the catalog entry to match them:

```python
self._model_access = ModelAccessComponent(
    node=self,
    parameter=model_param,
    model_choices=["kling-v2-master", "kling-v2-1-master"],
    default_model="kling-v2-master",
    deprecated_values={"Kling v2": "kling-v2-master", "Kling v2.1": "kling-v2-1-master"},
)
```

Each key is accepted wherever a value is assigned, including workflow load, and migrated to its mapped choice. Keys are never offered in the dropdown, so retiring a model means moving it from `model_choices` into `deprecated_values` pointed at its replacement. Every mapped value must be one of `model_choices`, and no key may already be a choice; either mistake raises when the node is constructed. If the model you are retiring was also the `default_model`, point `default_model` at its replacement in the same edit -- `default_model` must always name a current choice, never a retired key, and the component raises if it does not.

##### `model_usage`

A node references one or more catalog models by their dict keys. Use this when the node binds to a specific, named set of models. Each entry must resolve to a model somewhere in the catalog at library-load time; unresolved references surface as `UnresolvedModelUsageReferenceProblem`.

```jsonc
{ "type": "model_usage", "model_ids": ["claude_opus_byok", "kling_v2"] }
```

##### `model_provider_usage`

A node references one or more entire providers. Use this when a node dynamically enumerates every model a provider offers at runtime. Each entry must resolve to a provider declared in the catalog; unresolved references surface as `UnresolvedModelProviderUsageReferenceProblem`.

```jsonc
{ "type": "model_provider_usage", "provider_ids": ["anthropic", "ollama"] }
```

The two usage declarations are independent. A node can carry any combination — for instance, "every model this provider offers, plus these two specific models from another provider."

#### `arbitrary_python_execution`

Declares that a node executes arbitrary Python code supplied at runtime (for example, an artist-authored script). Node-level only. This is a security-relevant identity fact: consumers (UI) can warn an artist before the node runs. Absence of this declaration means the node does not execute arbitrary Python.

| Field                       | Meaning                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `executes_arbitrary_python` | `true` when the node runs unvetted, runtime-supplied Python. |

```jsonc
"declarations": [
  { "type": "arbitrary_python_execution", "executes_arbitrary_python": true }
]
```

#### Combining declarations

A node can carry any combination of declarations. For example, a Labs node that uses two models:

```jsonc
"metadata": {
  "category": "labs",
  "description": "Labs node demonstrating multiple declarations.",
  "display_name": "Labs Node",
  "declarations": [
    { "type": "lifecycle_stage", "stage": "LABS" },
    { "type": "model_usage", "model_ids": ["claude_opus_byok", "kling_v2"] }
  ]
}
```

New declaration types added in future engine releases land additively under this same `declarations` field without a schema-version bump.

### Beta Features

A beta feature lets you ship something new in your library but leave it off until users choose to
try it. Your features show up in the **Engine** group on the editor's
[Beta Features](../../guides/editor/beta_features.md) settings page, where users turn them on and off.
Name your library's nodes in each feature's `description`, so users can tell which library it
belongs to.

Declare each feature in a `beta_features` list at the top level of `griptape_nodes_library.json`,
next to `name`, `metadata`, and `nodes`. It is not part of `metadata`:

```jsonc
"beta_features": [
  {
    "id": "sharpen_after_upscale",
    "name": "Sharpen after upscaling",
    "description": "Adds a Sharpen setting to the Upscale Image node.",
    "owner": "@your-github-handle",
    "remove_by": "2027-03-31"
  }
]
```

Set `remove_by` to your own date, no more than 180 days from the day you add the feature.

| Field         | Meaning                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | Lowercase words of letters and digits joined by single underscores, starting with a letter. Unique within your library. |
| `name`        | Short label shown on the Beta Features page.                                                                            |
| `description` | One or two sentences telling users what changes and where.                                                              |
| `default`     | Optional. Whether the feature is on for users who haven't chosen. Defaults to `false`.                                  |
| `owner`       | Who is responsible for finishing or removing the feature.                                                               |
| `remove_by`   | `YYYY-MM-DD` date by which you make the feature standard or remove it. At most 180 days after you add it.               |

Check the feature from a node with `self.is_beta_feature_enabled("<id>")`. It returns the user's
choice, or `default` if they haven't made one. **Always create the parameters a feature uses, and
only hide or show them based on the feature.** A workflow saved by someone with the feature on then
still opens for someone with it off, and the other way around.

```python
from typing import Any

from griptape_nodes.exe_types.core_types import Parameter
from griptape_nodes.exe_types.node_types import DataNode


class UpscaleImage(DataNode):
    def __init__(self, name: str, metadata: dict[str, Any] | None = None) -> None:
        super().__init__(name, metadata)

        self.add_parameter(
            Parameter(name="image", input_types=["ImageArtifact"], type="ImageArtifact", tooltip="Image to upscale")
        )
        self.add_parameter(Parameter(name="upscaled_image", output_type="ImageArtifact", tooltip="The upscaled image"))

        # Created for everyone, shown only to users who turned the beta feature on.
        self.add_parameter(
            Parameter(
                name="sharpen",
                input_types=["float"],
                type="float",
                default_value=0.0,
                tooltip="How much to sharpen the image after upscaling",
            )
        )
        if not self.is_beta_feature_enabled("sharpen_after_upscale"):
            self.hide_parameter_by_name("sharpen")

    def process(self) -> None:
        image = self.get_parameter_value("image")
        upscaled = upscale(image)

        if self.is_beta_feature_enabled("sharpen_after_upscale"):
            upscaled = sharpen(upscaled, self.get_parameter_value("sharpen"))

        self.parameter_output_values["upscaled_image"] = upscaled
```

A few rules worth knowing:

- **A mistake in one entry doesn't stop your library from loading.** A missing field, an invalid
    `id`, or a repeated `id` is reported as a library problem, and that feature is left out. Your
    other features and nodes still work.
- **Checking an id you didn't declare returns `false`** and logs a warning naming the feature.
- **`is_beta_feature_enabled` returns `false` whenever the user turns all beta features off** with
    the **Enable beta features** switch, even for a feature with `default` set to `true`. The
    user's choice for your feature is kept and applies again when they turn the switch back on.
- **A check in `__init__` only runs when the node is created.** If a user turns the feature on or
    off, nodes already on the canvas keep the parameters they were shown with until the user refreshes the
    node, adds it again, or reopens the workflow. A check in `process` sees the new value on the next run.
- **After `remove_by`, the feature always uses its `default`.** It disappears from the Beta
    Features page and the library reports a problem until you make the feature standard or remove it.
    A `remove_by` more than 180 days away is also reported.
- **Users' choices are stored per library** under `library_beta_features` in their config, keyed by
    your library's name in lowercase with spaces and punctuation turned into underscores. "Acme
    Image Tools" becomes `library_beta_features.acme_image_tools.sharpen_after_upscale`. Only the
    letters a to z and digits carry over, so a library name without any can't have beta features,
    and two loaded libraries whose names become the same key are reported as a library problem.
- **Engines released before library schema `0.14.0` ignore `beta_features`.** Set
    `library_schema_version` to `0.14.0` or later when you add them.

#### Do not list the engine as a runtime dependency

The engine is the host that loads your library, not a package your library pulls in. Keep `griptape-nodes-engine` out of `[project] dependencies`:

- Installing your library would otherwise install a **second engine**. The engine puts a library's virtual environment at the front of its own import path, so that second copy can shadow the engine that is actually running, and the resulting errors look like engine bugs rather than library ones.
- `[dependency-groups] dev` still gives your tests, type checker, and editor an engine to resolve against, because `uv sync` installs dev groups by default. Your development workflow is unchanged.
- The engine version your library needs belongs in `engine_version` in your library JSON. That is the value the engine actually checks when it loads you; the pyproject specifier is never consulted at load time.

Declaring it in both places means maintaining the same fact twice, and the two drift.

!!! note "This changes with library packaging"

    Once libraries are resolved as packages into their own environments, the engine becomes a normal bounded dependency (`griptape-nodes-engine>=X,<Y`) and that single resolution replaces the `engine_version` check. Use the layout above until that ships.

### Library Configuration (inside subdirectory)

Place `griptape_nodes_library.json` inside the library subdirectory:

```json
{
  "name": "Library Name",
  "library_schema_version": "0.1.0",
  "settings": [
    {
      "description": "API keys required by nodes",
      "category": "app_events.on_app_initialization_complete",
      "contents": {
        "secrets_to_register": ["API_KEY_NAME"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "nodes": [
    {
      "class_name": "NodeClassName",
      "file_path": "node_file.py", // Relative to library subdirectory
      "metadata": {
        "category": "category_name",
        "description": "Node description",
        "display_name": "Node Display Name"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Installation Instructions in README

### Troubleshooting Entries Worth Documenting

Two errors come up often enough that a library README's troubleshooting section should cover them:

#### Error: "Missing required variables: file_extension, file_name_base"

**Full Error:**

```text
ERROR: Attempted to resolve macro path. Failed because missing required variables: file_extension, file_name_base
ERROR: Attempted to create download URL. Failed with file_path='{outputs}/{node_name?:_}{file_name_base}{_index?:03}.{file_extension}'
```

**Cause:** Not capturing the return value from `write_bytes()`. Using `dest.location` instead of `saved.location`.

**Incorrect Code:**

```python
dest = self._output_file.build_file()
dest.write_bytes(video_bytes)  # ❌ Return value not captured
artifact = VideoUrlArtifact(dest.location)  # Using dest, not saved file
```

**Solution:**

```python
dest = self._output_file.build_file()
saved = dest.write_bytes(video_bytes)  # ✅ Capture the saved file
artifact = VideoUrlArtifact(saved.location)  # Use saved file's resolved location
```

**Explanation:** Macro variables are populated when `write_bytes()` actually saves the file. The `saved` object returned by `write_bytes()` contains the fully resolved path.

#### Error: Type Conversion Issues with Image Parameters

**Symptom:** Image parameters don't handle different input types consistently, or errors occur when passing URLs, file paths, or artifacts between nodes.

**Problem:** Using generic `Parameter` with manual type configuration doesn't standardize type conversion logic:

```python
# ❌ Inconsistent type handling
Parameter(
    name="image",
    input_types=["ImageArtifact", "ImageUrlArtifact", "str"],
    type="ImageArtifact",
)
```

**Solution:** Use `ParameterImage` for standardized type conversion:

```python
# ✅ Standardized type handling
ParameterImage(
    name="image",
    tooltip="Input image",
    allow_output=False,
)
```

**Benefits:**

- Declares `ImageUrlArtifact` instead of `ImageArtifact`, keeping the parameter's value small — see [Parameter Payload Size](error_handling.md#parameter-payload-size)
- Handles ImageArtifact, ImageUrlArtifact, and strings consistently
- Built-in support for URLs, file paths, and data URIs
- Graceful error handling for various input formats
- Reduces type conversion errors in complex workflows

### Model Comparison Table

Always include a comparison table for services with multiple models:

```markdown
| Model | Max Duration | Quality  | Speed   | Character Limits          |
| ----- | ------------ | -------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| V5    | 4 min        | Superior | Fastest | Prompt: 5000, Style: 1000 |
| V4_5  | 8 min        | High     | Fast    | Prompt: 5000, Style: 1000 |
| V4    | 4 min        | Best     | Medium  | Prompt: 3000, Style: 200  |
```

## Contributing to the Standard Library

When adding nodes to the core `griptape_nodes_library` (as opposed to creating a standalone library), follow this process:

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
cd griptape-nodes
git checkout -b feature/add-color-match-node
```

### 2. Add the Node File

Place your node in the appropriate category subdirectory:

```
libraries/griptape_nodes_library/griptape_nodes_library/
├── image/
│   ├── color_match.py      # New node file
│   ├── load_image.py
│   └── save_image.py
├── text/
├── audio/
└── ...
```

### 3. Update griptape_nodes_library.json

Make three updates to `libraries/griptape_nodes_library/griptape_nodes_library.json`:

#### a. Increment the library version

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "library_version": "0.59.0" // Was 0.58.0
  }
}
```

#### b. Add any new pip dependencies

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "dependencies": {
      "pip_dependencies": [
        "existing-dep",
        "color-matcher" // New dependency
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### c. Add the node entry

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "class_name": "ColorMatch",
      "file_path": "griptape_nodes_library/image/color_match.py",
      "metadata": {
        "category": "image",
        "description": "Transfer color characteristics from a reference image to a target image",
        "display_name": "Color Match",
        "icon": "palette",
        "group": "edit"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Add Documentation

Create a documentation page at `docs/nodes/<category>/<node_name>.md`:

```markdown
# Color Match

Transfer color characteristics from a reference image to a target image.

## What It Does

Applies the color palette from a reference image to a target image...

## Parameters

### Inputs

| Parameter       | Type             | Description                 |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| reference_image | ImageUrlArtifact | Source of the color palette |
| target_image    | ImageUrlArtifact | Image to apply colors to    |

### Outputs

| Parameter    | Type             | Description          |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| output_image | ImageUrlArtifact | Color-matched result |

## Example Usage

1. Connect a reference image with desired colors
2. Connect the target image to transform
3. Run the node

## Technical Details

Uses the color-matcher library with histogram matching...
```

### 5. Update mkdocs.yml Navigation

Add your doc page to the navigation in `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
nav:
  - Nodes Reference:
      - Image:
          - Load Image: nodes/image/load_image.md
          - Save Image: nodes/image/save_image.md
          - Color Match: nodes/image/color_match.md # New entry
```

### 6. Run Quality Checks

Before committing, run formatting and checks:

```bash
make format        # Auto-format code
make check/lint    # Check for linting issues
make check/types   # Check for type errors
```

Fix any issues that arise before proceeding.

### 7. Commit and Create PR

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(image): add ColorMatch node for color transfer"
git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create --title "Add ColorMatch node" --body "## Summary
- Adds ColorMatch node for transferring colors between images
- Uses color-matcher library
- Includes documentation

## Test plan
- [ ] Load two images
- [ ] Run color match
- [ ] Verify output has reference colors"
```

### Standard Library vs External Library

| Aspect       | Standard Library                            | External Library                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Location     | `griptape-nodes` repo                       | Separate repo                     |
| Installation | Included by default                         | User installs                     |
| Review       | Requires PR approval                        | Self-published                    |
| Dependencies | Added to core `griptape_nodes_library.json` | Own `griptape_nodes_library.json` |
| Versioning   | Follows core library version                | Independent versioning            |
| Docs         | Added to main docs site                     | README in library                 |

**When to contribute to standard library:**

- Node has broad utility for many users
- No proprietary/paid API dependencies
- Stable, well-tested implementation
- Follows all code quality standards

**When to create external library:**

- Niche use case
- Requires paid API keys
- Experimental/rapidly changing
- Want independent release cycle
